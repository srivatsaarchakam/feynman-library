When we have a picture that is symmetrical, one side is somehow the same as the other side. Professor Hermann Weyl has given this definition of symmetry: a thing is symmetrical if one can subject it to a certain operation and it appears exactly the same after the operation. For instance, if we look at a silhouette of a vase that is left-and-right symmetrical, then turn it\n180\n\u2218\n around the vertical axis, it looks the same.

In previous chapters we have seen that the laws of mechanics can be summarized by a set of three equations for each particle:\nm(\nd\n2\nx/d\nt\n2\n)=\nF\nx\n,\nm(\nd\n2\ny/d\nt\n2\n)=\nF\ny\n,\nm(\nd\n2\nz/d\nt\n2\n)=\nF\nz\n.\n(11.1)\nNow this means that there exists a way to measure\nx\n, \ny\n, and \nz\non three perpendicular axes, and the forces along those directions, such that these laws are true. These must be measured from some origin, but where do we put the origin? All that Newton would tell us at first is that there is some place that we can measure from, perhaps the center of the universe, such that these laws are correct. But we can show immediately that we can never find the center, because if we use some other origin it would make no difference. In other words, suppose that there are two people\u2014Joe, who has an origin in one place, and Moe, who has a parallel system whose origin is somewhere else (Fig. 11\u20131). Now when Joe measures the location of the point in space, he finds it at\nx\n, \ny\n, and \nz\n(we shall usually leave\nz\nout because it is too confusing to draw in a picture). Moe, on the other hand, when measuring the same point, will obtain a different \nx\n(in order to distinguish it, we will call it \nx\n\u2032\n), and in principle a different \ny\n, although in our example they are numerically equal. So we have\nx\n\u2032\ny\n\u2032\nz\n\u2032\n=x\u2212a,\n=y,\n=z.\n(11.2)\nNow in order to complete our analysis we must know what Moe would obtain for the forces. The force is supposed to act along some line, and by the force in the\nx\n-direction we mean the part of the total which is in the\nx\n-direction, which is the magnitude of the force times this cosine of its angle with the\nx\n-axis. Now we see that Moe would use exactly the same projection as Joe would use, so we have a set of equations\nF\nx\n\u2032\nF\ny\n\u2032\nF\nz\n\u2032\n=\nF\nx\n,\n=\nF\ny\n,\n=\nF\nz\n.\n(11.3)\nThese would be the relationships between quantities as seen by Joe and Moe."

So the proof that an apparatus in a new position behaves the same as it did in the old position is the same as the proof that the equations when displaced in space reproduce themselves. Therefore we say that the laws of physics are symmetrical for translational displacements, symmetrical in the sense that the laws do not change when we make a translation of our coordinates.

The next proposition is that it should make no difference in which direction we choose the axes. In other words, if we build a piece of equipment in some place and watch it operate, and nearby we build the same kind of apparatus but put it up on an angle, will it operate in the same way? Obviously it will not if it is a Grandfather clock, for example! If a pendulum clock stands upright, it works fine, but if it is tilted the pendulum falls against the side of the case and nothing happens. The theorem is then false in the case of the pendulum clock, unless we include the earth, which is pulling on the pendulum. Therefore we can make a prediction about pendulum clocks if we believe in the symmetry of physical law for rotation: something else is involved in the operation of a pendulum clock besides the machinery of the clock, something outside it that we should look for. We may also predict that pendulum clocks will not work the same way when located in different places relative to this mysterious source of asymmetry, perhaps the earth. Indeed, we know that a pendulum clock up in an artificial satellite, for example, would not tick either, because there is no effective force, and on Mars it would go at a different rate. Pendulum clocks do involve something more than just the machinery inside, they involve something on the outside. Once we recognize this factor, we see that we must turn the earth along with the apparatus. Of course we do not have to worry about that, it is easy to do; one simply waits a moment or two and the earth turns; then the pendulum clock ticks again in the new position the same as it did before. While we are rotating in space our angles are always changing, absolutely; this change does not seem to bother us very much, for in the new position we seem to be in the same condition as in the old. This has a certain tendency to confuse one, because it is true that in the new turned position the laws are the same as in the unturned position, but it is not true that as we turn a thing it follows the same laws as it does when we are not turning it. If we perform sufficiently delicate experiments, we can tell that the earth is rotating, but not that it had rotated. In other words, we cannot locate its angular position, but we can tell that it is changing."

Assume that Moe\u2019s axes have rotated relative to Joe\u2019s by an angle \n\u03b8\n. The two coordinate systems are shown in Fig. 11\u20132, which is restricted to two dimensions.

Let us assume that a force \nF\n, which has already been analyzed as having components\nF\nx\nand \nF\ny\n(as seen by Joe), is acting on a particle of mass \nm\n, located at point \nP\nin Fig. 11\u20132. For simplicity, let us move both sets of axes so that the origin is at \nP\n, as shown in Fig. 11\u20133. Moe sees the components of \nF\nalong his axes as\nF\nx\n\u2032\nand \nF\ny\n\u2032\n.\nF\nx\nhas components along both the\nx\n\u2032\n- and\ny\n\u2032\n-axes, and\nF\ny\nlikewise has components along both these axes. To express \nF\nx\n\u2032\nin terms of\nF\nx\nand \nF\ny\n, we sum these components along the\nx\n\u2032\n-axis, and in a like manner we can express\nF\ny\n\u2032\nin terms of\nF\nx\nand \nF\ny\n. The results are\nF\nx\n\u2032\nF\ny\n\u2032\nF\nz\n\u2032\n=\nF\nx\n=\nF\ny\n=\nF\nz\ncos\u03b8+\nF\ny\ncos\u03b8\u2212\nF\nx\n.\nsin\u03b8,\nsin\u03b8,\n(11.6)\nIt is interesting to note an accident of sorts, which is of extreme importance: the formulas (11.5) and (11.6), for coordinates of \nP\nand components of \nF\n, respectively, are of identical form."

Other quantities that are important in physics do have direction, for instance velocity: we have to keep track of which way a body is going, not just its speed. Momentum and force also have direction, as does displacement: when someone steps from one place to another in space, we can keep track of how far he went, but if we wish also to know where he went, we have to specify a direction."

In order to represent a step in space, say from the origin to some particular point \nP\nwhose location is \n(x,y,z)\n, we really need three numbers, but we are going to invent a single mathematical symbol,\nr\n, which is unlike any other mathematical symbols we have so far used.1 It is not a single number, it represents three numbers:\nx\n, \ny\n, and \nz\n. It means three numbers, but not really only those three numbers, because if we were to use a different coordinate system, the three numbers would be changed to\nx\n\u2032\n, \ny\n\u2032\n, and \nz\n\u2032\n. However, we want to keep our mathematics simple and so we are going to use the same mark to represent the three numbers \n(x,y,z)\nand the three numbers \n(\nx\n\u2032\n,\ny\n\u2032\n,\nz\n\u2032\n)\n. That is, we use the same mark to represent the first set of three numbers for one coordinate system, but the second set of three numbers if we are using the other coordinate system. This has the advantage that when we change the coordinate system, we do not have to change the letters of our equations. If we write an equation in terms of\nx,y,z\n, and then use another system, we have to change to\nx\n\u2032\n,\ny\n\u2032\n,\nz\n\u2032\n, but we shall just write \nr\n, with the convention that it represents\n(x,y,z)\nif we use one set of axes, or\n(\nx\n\u2032\n,\ny\n\u2032\n,\nz\n\u2032\n)\nif we use another set of axes, and so on. The three numbers which describe the quantity in a given coordinate system are called the components of the vector in the direction of the coordinate axes of that system. That is, we use the same symbol for the three letters that correspond to the same object, as seen from different axes. The very fact that we can say \u201cthe same object\u201d implies a physical intuition about the reality of a step in space, that is independent of the components in terms of which we measure it. So the symbol \nr\nwill represent the same thing no matter how we turn the axes."

For many purposes it is convenient to represent a vector quantity by an arrow that indicates the direction in which it is acting. Why can we represent force, say, by an arrow? Because it has the same mathematical transformation properties as a \u201cstep in space.\u201d We thus represent it in a diagram as if it were a step, using a scale such that one unit of force, or one newton, corresponds to a certain convenient length. Once we have done this, all forces can be represented as lengths, because an equation like\nF=kr,\nF\nk\nwhere\nk\nis some constant, is a perfectly legitimate equation. Thus we can always represent forces by lines, which is very convenient, because once we have drawn the line we no longer need the axes. Of course, we can quickly calculate the three components as they change upon turning the axes, because that is just a geometric problem."

In order for it to be a vector, not only must there be three numbers, but these must be associated with a coordinate system in such a way that if we turn the coordinate system, the three numbers \u201crevolve\u201d on each other, get \u201cmixed up\u201d in each other, by the precise laws we have already described.

The answer is, of course, yes, because the prototype transformations of Eq. (11.5) constitute what we call a linear transformation. If we apply those transformations to\na\nx\nand \nb\nx\nto get\na\nx\n\u2032\n+\nb\nx\n\u2032\n, we find that the transformed\na\nx\n+\nb\nx\nis indeed the same as\na\nx\n\u2032\n+\nb\nx\n\u2032\n.

Suppose, for instance, that a particle is moving on some complicated curve (Fig. 11\u20137) and that, at a given instant \nt\n1\n, it had a certain velocity \nv\n1\n, but that when we go to another instant \nt\n2\na little later, it has a different velocity \nv\n2\n. What is the acceleration? Answer: Acceleration is the difference in the velocity divided by the small time interval, so we need the difference of the two velocities. How do we get the difference of the velocities? To subtract two vectors, we put the vector across the ends of\nv\n2\nand \nv\n1\n; that is, we draw \n\u0394v\nas the difference of the two vectors, right? No! That only works when the tails of the vectors are in the same place! It has no meaning if we move the vector somewhere else and then draw a line across, so watch out! We have to draw a new diagram to subtract the vectors. In Fig. 11\u20138,\nv\n1\nand \nv\n2\nare both drawn parallel and equal to their counterparts in Fig. 11\u20137, and now we can discuss the acceleration. Of course the acceleration is simply \n\u0394v/\u0394t\n. It is interesting to note that we can compose the velocity difference out of two parts; we can think of acceleration as having two components,\n\u0394\nv\n\u2225\n, in the direction tangent to the path and \n\u0394\nv\n\u22a5\nat right angles to the path, as indicated in Fig. 11\u20138. The acceleration tangent to the path is, of course, just the change in the length of the vector, i.e., the change in the speed \nv\n:\na\n\u2225\n=dv/dt.\n(11.15)\nThe other component of acceleration, at right angles to the curve, is easy to calculate, using Figs. 11\u20137 and 11\u20138. In the short time \n\u0394t\nlet the change in angle between\nv\n1\nand \nv\n2\nbe the small angle \n\u0394\u03b8\n. If the magnitude of the velocity is called \nv\n, then of course\n\u0394\nv\n\u22a5\n=v\u0394\u03b8\n\u0394\n\u0394\n\u03b8\nand the acceleration\na\nwill be\na\n\u22a5\n=v(\u0394\u03b8/\u0394t).\n(\n\u03b8\n/\n)\nNow we need to know\n\u0394\u03b8/\u0394t\n, which can be found this way: If, at the given moment, the curve is approximated as a circle of a certain radius \nR\n, then in a time \n\u0394t\nthe distance \ns\nis, of course,\nv\u0394t\n, where\nv\nis the speed.\n\u0394\u03b8=(v\u0394t)/R,or\u0394\u03b8/\u0394t=v/R.\n\u03b8\n(\n)\n/\n\u03b8\n/\n/\nTherefore, we find\na\n\u22a5\n=\nv\n2\n/R,\n(11.16)\nas we have seen before."

For such purposes, it is useful to invent what we call a unit vector in the direction that we want to study. By a unit vector we mean one whose dot product with itself is equal to unity. Let us call this unit vector \ni\n; then \ni\u22c5i=1\n. Then, if we want the component of some vector in the direction of \ni\n, we see that the dot product \na\u22c5i\nwill be \nacos\u03b8\n, i.e., the component of \na\nin the direction of \ni\n. This is a nice way to get the component; in fact, it permits us to get all the components and to write a rather amusing formula. Suppose that in a given system of coordinates,\nx\n, \ny\n, and \nz\n, we invent three vectors:\ni\n, a unit vector in the direction \nx\n;\nj\n, a unit vector in the direction \ny\n; and\nk\n, a unit vector in the direction \nz\n. Note first that \ni\u22c5i=1\n. What is \ni\u22c5j\n? When two vectors are at right angles, their dot product is zero. Thus\ni\u22c5i\ni\u22c5j\ni\u22c5k\n=1\n=0\n=0\nj\u22c5j\nj\u22c5k\n=1\n=0\nk\u22c5k\n=1\n(11.24)\nNow with these definitions, any vector whatsoever can be written this way:\na=\na\nx\ni+\na\ny\nj+\na\nz\nk.\n(11.25)\nBy this means we can go from the components of a vector to the vector itself."
