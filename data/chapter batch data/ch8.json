Let us consider some solid object with a permanent mark, which we shall call a point, that we can observe. We shall discuss the motion of the little marker, which might be the radiator cap of an automobile or the center of a falling ball, and shall try to describe the fact that it moves and how it moves."

We do not know a simple way to analyze a change of mind, but since the cloud can be represented or described by many molecules, perhaps we can describe the motion of the cloud in principle by describing the motion of all its individual molecules. Likewise, perhaps even the changes in the mind may have a parallel in changes of the atoms inside the brain, but we have no such knowledge yet."

For instance, in describing the motion of a car that is going a hundred miles, we do not have to distinguish between the front and the back of the car. To be sure, there are slight differences, but for rough purposes we say \u201cthe car,\u201d and likewise it does not matter that our points are not absolute points; for our present purposes it is not necessary to be extremely precise. Also, while we take a first look at this subject we are going to forget about the three dimensions of the world. We shall just concentrate on moving in one direction, as in a car on one road. We shall return to three dimensions after we see how to describe motion in one dimension. Now, you may say, \u201cThis is all some kind of trivia,\u201d and indeed it is. How can we describe such a one-dimensional motion\u2014let us say, of a car? Nothing could be simpler. Among many possible ways, one would be the following. To determine the position of the car at different times, we measure its distance from the starting point and record all the observations. In Table 8\u20131,\ns\nrepresents the distance of the car, in feet, from the starting point, and\nt\nrepresents the time in minutes. The first line in the table represents zero distance and zero time\u2014the car has not started yet. After one minute it has started and has gone\n1200\n feet. Then in two minutes, it goes farther\u2014notice that it picked up more distance in the second minute\u2014it has accelerated; but something happened between\n3\nand \n4\nand even more so at \n5\n\u2014it stopped at a light perhaps? Then it speeds up again and goes\n13,000\n feet by the end of\n6\n minutes,\n18,000\n feet at the end of\n7\n minutes, and\n23,500\n feet in\n8\n minutes; at\n9\n minutes it has advanced to only\n24,000\n feet, because in the last minute it was stopped by a cop."

In the first place, what do we mean by time and space? It turns out that these deep philosophical questions have to be analyzed very carefully in physics, and this is not so easy to do. The theory of relativity shows that our ideas of space and time are not as simple as one might think at first sight. However, for our present purposes, for the accuracy that we need at first, we need not be very careful about defining things precisely. Perhaps you say, \u201cThat\u2019s a terrible thing\u2014I learned that in science we have to define everything precisely.\u201d We cannot define anything precisely! If we attempt to, we get into that paralysis of thought that comes to philosophers, who sit opposite each other, one saying to the other, \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you are talking about!\u201d The second one says, \u201cWhat do you mean by know? What do you mean by talking? What do you mean by you?,\u201d and so on. In order to be able to talk constructively, we just have to agree that we are talking about roughly the same thing.

The subtlety comes when we try to comprehend exactly what is meant by \u201cspeed.\u201d The Greeks got very confused about this, and a new branch of mathematics had to be discovered beyond the geometry and algebra of the Greeks, Arabs, and Babylonians. As an illustration of the difficulty, try to solve this problem by sheer algebra: A balloon is being inflated so that the volume of the balloon is increasing at the rate of\n100\n cm\u00b3 per second; at what speed is the radius increasing when the volume is\n1000\n cm\u00b3? The Greeks were somewhat confused by such problems, being helped, of course, by some very confusing Greeks. To show that there were difficulties in reasoning about speed at the time, Zeno produced a large number of paradoxes, of which we shall mention one to illustrate his point that there are obvious difficulties in thinking about motion. \u201cListen,\u201d he says, \u201cto the following argument: Achilles runs\n10\n times as fast as a tortoise, nevertheless he can never catch the tortoise. For, suppose that they start in a race where the tortoise is\n100\n meters ahead of Achilles; then when Achilles has run the\n100\n meters to the place where the tortoise was, the tortoise has proceeded\n10\n meters, having run one-tenth as fast. Now, Achilles has to run another\n10\n meters to catch up with the tortoise, but on arriving at the end of that run, he finds that the tortoise is still\n1\n meter ahead of him; running another meter, he finds the tortoise\n10\n centimeters ahead, and so on, ad infinitum. Therefore, at any moment the tortoise is always ahead of Achilles and Achilles can never catch up with the tortoise.\u201d What is wrong with that? It is that a finite amount of time can be divided into an infinite number of pieces, just as a length of line can be divided into an infinite number of pieces by dividing repeatedly by two. And so, although there are an infinite number of steps (in the argument) to the point at which Achilles reaches the tortoise, it doesn\u2019t mean that there is an infinite amount of time. We can see from this example that there are indeed some subtleties in reasoning about speed."

What does that mean\u2014kept on accelerating, going faster? No\u2014kept on going with the same velocity. But that is what we are trying to define!

In other words, she does not have to keep on going for the whole hour; the point is that for a moment she is going at that speed. Now what that means is that if she went just a little bit more in time, the extra distance she goes would be the same as that of a car that goes at a steady speed of\n60\n miles an hour. Perhaps the idea of the\n88\n feet per second is right; we see how far she went in the last second, divide by\n88\n feet, and if it comes out \n1\nthe speed was\n60\n miles an hour. In other words, we can find the speed in this way: We ask, how far do we go in a very short time? We divide that distance by the time, and that gives the speed. But the time should be made as short as possible, the shorter the better, because some change could take place during that time. If we take the time of a falling body as an hour, the idea is ridiculous. If we take it as a second, the result is pretty good for a car, because there is not much change in speed, but not for a falling body; so in order to get the speed more and more accurately, we should take a smaller and smaller time interval. What we should do is take a millionth of a second, find out how far the car has gone, and divide that distance by a millionth of a second. The result gives the distance per second, which is what we mean by the velocity, so we can define it that way.

                "data": "Let us take as an example the problem of determining the velocity of the falling ball at the particular time\n5\n seconds. One way to do this is to see from Table 8\u20132 what it did in the\n5\nth second; it went\n400\u2212256=144\n ft, so it is going\n144\n ft/sec; however, that is wrong, because the speed is changing; on the average it is\n144\n ft/sec during this interval, but the ball is speeding up and is really going faster than\n144\n ft/sec. We want to find out exactly how fast. The technique involved in this process is the following: We know where the ball was at\n5\n sec. At\n5.1\n sec, the distance that it has gone all together is\n16(5.1\n)\n2\n=416.16\n ft (see Eq. 8.1). At\n5\n sec it had already fallen\n400\n ft; in the last tenth of a second it fell\n416.16\u2212400=16.16\n ft. Since\n16.16\n ft in\n0.1\n sec is the same as\n161.6\n ft/sec, that is the speed more or less, but it is not exactly correct. Is that the speed at \n5\n, or at \n5.1\n, or halfway between at\n5.05\n sec, or when is that the speed? Never mind\u2014the problem was to find the speed at\n5\n seconds, and we do not have exactly that; we have to do a better job. So, we take one-thousandth of a second more than \n5\nsec, or\n5.001\n sec, and calculate the total fall as\ns=16(5.001\n)\n2\n=16(25.010001)\n=400.160016 ft.\nIn the last\n0.001\n sec the ball fell\n0.160016\n ft, and if we divide this number by\n0.001\n sec we obtain the speed as\n160.016\n ft/sec. That is closer, very close, but it is still not exact. It should now be evident what we must do to find the speed exactly. To perform the mathematics we state the problem a little more abstractly: to find the velocity at a special time,\nt\n0\n, which in the original problem was\n5\n sec. Now the distance at \nt\n0\n, which we call \ns\n0\n, is \n16\nt\n2\n0\n, or\n400\n ft in this case. In order to find the velocity, we ask, \u201cAt the time \nt\n0\n+(a little bit)\n, or \nt\n0\n+\u03f5\n, where is the body?\u201d The new position is \n16(\nt\n0\n+\u03f5\n)\n2\n=16\nt\n2\n0\n+32\nt\n0\n\u03f5+16\n\u03f5\n2\n. So it is farther along than it was before, because before it was only \n16\nt\n2\n0\n. This distance we shall call \ns\n0\n+(a little bit more)\n, or \ns\n0\n+x\n(if \nx\nis the extra bit). Now if we subtract the distance at \nt\n0\nfrom the distance at \nt\n0\n+\u03f5\n, we get \nx\n, the extra distance gone, as \nx=32\nt\n0\n\u22c5\u03f5+16\n\u03f5\n2\n. Our first approximation to the velocity is\nv=\nx\n\u03f5\n=32\nt\n0\n+16\u03f5.\n(8.4)\nThe true velocity is the value of this ratio,\nx/\u03f5\n, when\n\u03f5\nbecomes vanishingly small. In other words, after forming the ratio, we take the limit as \n\u03f5\ngets smaller and smaller, that is, approaches \n0\n. The equation reduces to,\nv(at time \nt\n0\n)=32\nt\n0\n.\n(\n)\nIn our problem,\nt\n0\n=5\n sec, so the solution is\nv=\n32\u00d75=\n160\n ft/sec. A few lines above, where we took \n\u03f5\nas \n0.1\nand\n0.001\n sec successively, the value we got for \nv\nwas a little more than this, but now we see that the actual velocity is precisely\n160\n ft/sec."

The\nds\n\u2019s and \ndt\n\u2019s which appear separately are called differentials. To familiarize you with the words, we say we found the derivative of the function \n16\nt\n2\n, or the derivative (with respect to \nt\n) of \n16\nt\n2\nis \n32t\n. When we get used to the words, the ideas are more easily understood. For practice, let us find the derivative of a more complicated function. We shall consider the formula \ns=A\nt\n3\n+Bt+C\n, which might describe the motion of a point. The letters\nA\n, \nB\n, and \nC\nrepresent constant numbers, as in the familiar general form of a quadratic equation. Starting from the formula for the motion, we wish to find the velocity at any time. To find the velocity in the more elegant manner, we change\nt\nto \nt+\u0394t\nand note that \ns\nis then changed to \ns+some \u0394s\n; then we find the \n\u0394s\nin terms of \n\u0394t\n. That is to say,\ns+\u0394s\n=A(t+\u0394t\n)\n3\n+B(t+\u0394t)+C\n=A\nt\n3\n+Bt+C+3A\nt\n2\n\u0394t+B\u0394t\n+3At(\u0394t\n)\n2\n+A(\u0394t\n)\n3\n,\nbut since\ns=A\nt\n3\n+Bt+C,\n3\nwe find that\n\u0394s=3A\nt\n2\n\u0394t+B\u0394t+3At(\u0394t\n)\n2\n+A(\u0394t\n)\n3\n.\n2\n3\nBut we do not want \n\u0394s\n\u2014we want \n\u0394s\ndivided by \n\u0394t\n.

The process is even more simple than it appears. Observe that when these expansions contain any term with a square or a cube or any higher power of \n\u0394t\n, such terms may be dropped at once, since they will go to \n0\nwhen the limit is taken. After a little practice the process gets easier because one knows what to leave out. There are many rules or formulas for differentiating various types of functions. These can be memorized, or can be found in tables. A short list is found in Table 8\u20133."

                "data": "Now we have to discuss the inverse problem. Suppose that instead of a table of distances, we have a table of speeds at different times, starting from zero. For the falling ball, such speeds and times are shown in Table 8\u20134. A similar table could be constructed for the velocity of the car, by recording the speedometer reading every minute or half-minute. If we know how fast the car is going at any time, can we determine how far it goes? This problem is just the inverse of the one solved above; we are given the velocity and asked to find the distance. How can we find the distance if we know the speed? If the speed of the car is not constant, and the lady goes sixty miles an hour for a moment, then slows down, speeds up, and so on, how can we determine how far she has gone? That is easy. We use the same idea, and express the distance in terms of infinitesimals. Let us say, \u201cIn the first second her speed was such and such, and from the formula \n\u0394s=v\u0394t\nwe can calculate how far the car went the first second at that speed.\u201d Now in the next second her speed is nearly the same, but slightly different; we can calculate how far she went in the next second by taking the new speed times the time. We proceed similarly for each second, to the end of the run. We now have a number of little distances, and the total distance will be the sum of all these little pieces. That is, the distance will be the sum of the velocities times the times, or \ns=\u2211v\u0394t\n, where the Greek letter \n\u2211\n(sigma) is used to denote addition. To be more precise, it is the sum of the velocity at a certain time, let us say the\ni\n-th time, multiplied by \n\u0394t\n.\ns=\n\u2211\ni\nv(\nt\ni\n)\u0394t.\n(8.6)\nThe rule for the times is that \nt\ni+1\n=\nt\ni\n+\u0394t\n. However, the distance we obtain by this method will not be correct, because the velocity changes during the time interval \n\u0394t\n. If we take the times short enough, the sum is precise, so we take them smaller and smaller until we obtain the desired accuracy. The true \ns\nis\ns=\nlim\n\u0394t\u21920\n\u2211\ni\nv(\nt\ni\n)\u0394t.\n(8.7)\nThe mathematicians have invented a symbol for this limit, analogous to the symbol for the differential. The \n\u0394\nturns into a \nd\nto remind us that the time is as small as it can be; the velocity is then called \nv\nat the time \nt\n, and the addition is written as a sum with a great \u201c\ns\n,\u201d\n\u222b\n(from the Latin summa), which has become distorted and is now unfortunately just called an integral sign. Thus we write\ns=\u222bv(t)dt.\n(8.8)\nThis process of adding all these terms together is called integration, and it is the opposite process to differentiation. The derivative of this integral is \nv\n, so one operator (\nd\n) undoes the other (\n\u222b\n). One can get formulas for integrals by taking the formulas for derivatives and running them backwards, because they are related to each other inversely. Thus one can work out his own table of integrals by differentiating all sorts of functions. For every formula with a differential, we get an integral formula if we turn it around."

You may have heard with great excitement about some car that can get from rest to\n60\n miles an hour in ten seconds flat. From such a performance we can see how fast the speed changes, but only on the average. What we shall now discuss is the next level of complexity, which is how fast the velocity is changing. In other words, by how many feet per second does the velocity change in a second, that is, how many feet per second, per second? We previously derived the formula for the velocity of a falling body as \nv=32t\n, which is charted in Table 8\u20134, and now we want to find out how much the velocity changes per second; this quantity is called the acceleration."

Consider a particle \nP\nwhich moves in three dimensions in any manner whatsoever. At the beginning of this chapter, we opened our discussion of the one-dimensional case of a moving car by observing the distance of the car from its starting point at various times. We then discussed velocity in terms of changes of these distances with time, and acceleration in terms of changes in velocity. We can treat three-dimensional motion analogously. It will be simpler to illustrate the motion on a two-dimensional diagram, and then extend the ideas to three dimensions. We establish a pair of axes at right angles to each other, and determine the position of the particle at any moment by measuring how far it is from each of the two axes. Thus each position is given in terms of an\nx\n-distance and a\ny\n-distance, and the motion can be described by constructing a table in which both these distances are given as functions of time. (Extension of this process to three dimensions requires only another axis, at right angles to the first two, and measuring a third distance, the\nz\n-distance. The distances are now measured from coordinate planes instead of lines.) Having constructed a table with\nx\n- and\ny\n-distances, how can we determine the velocity? We first find the components of velocity in each direction. The horizontal part of the velocity, or\nx\n-component, is the derivative of the\nx\n-distance with respect to the time, or\nv\nx\n=dx/dt.\n(8.11)\nSimilarly, the vertical part of the velocity, or\ny\n-component, is\nv\ny\n=dy/dt.\n(8.12)\nIn the third dimension,\nv\nz\n=dz/dt.\n(8.13)"
