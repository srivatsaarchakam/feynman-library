Nevertheless, everyone knows that he begins to sweat, shake, and breathe harder, as if he were running up a flight of stairs. Yet running upstairs is considered as doing work (in running downstairs, one gets work out of the world, according to physics), but in simply holding an object in a fixed position, no work is done. Clearly, the physical definition of work differs from the physiological definition, for reasons we shall briefly explore."

Why is the machinery inside him operating at full throttle, just to hold the weight up? Actually, the weight could be held up with no effort by just placing it on a table; then the table, quietly and calmly, without any supply of energy, is able to maintain the same weight at the same height! The physiological situation is something like the following. There are two kinds of muscles in the human body and in other animals: one kind, called striated or skeletal muscle, is the type of muscle we have in our arms, for example, which is under voluntary control; the other kind, called smooth muscle, is like the muscle in the intestines or, in the clam, the greater adductor muscle that closes the shell. The smooth muscles work very slowly, but they can hold a \u201cset\u201d; that is to say, if the clam tries to close its shell in a certain position, it will hold that position, even if there is a very great force trying to change it. It will hold a position under load for hours and hours without getting tired because it is very much like a table holding up a weight, it \u201csets\u201d into a certain position, and the molecules just lock there temporarily with no work being done, no effort being generated by the clam. The fact that we have to generate effort to hold up a weight is simply due to the design of striated muscle. What happens is that when a nerve impulse reaches a muscle fiber, the fiber gives a little twitch and then relaxes, so that when we hold something up, enormous volleys of nerve impulses are coming in to the muscle, large numbers of twitches are maintaining the weight, while the other fibers relax. We can see this, of course: when we hold a heavy weight and get tired, we begin to shake. The reason is that the volleys are coming irregularly, and the muscle is tired and not reacting fast enough. Why such an inefficient scheme? We do not know exactly why, but evolution has not been able to develop fast smooth muscle. Smooth muscle would be much more effective for holding up weights because you could just stand there and it would lock in; there would be no work involved and no energy would be required. However, it has the disadvantage that it is very slow-operating."

If we calculate how much work is done by a force in moving an object from one point to another along some curved path, in general the work depends upon the curve, but in special cases it does not.

Then, the work line-integral from\n1\nto \n2\n, which we want to calculate, can be evaluated as the work done in going from\n1\nto \nP\nplus the work done in going from\nP\nto \n2\n, because the forces are conservative and the work does not depend upon the curve. Now, the work done in going from position \nP\nto a particular position in space is a function of that position in space. Of course it really depends on \nP\nalso, but we hold the arbitrary point \nP\nfixed permanently for the analysis. If that is done, then the work done in going from point \nP\nto point \n2\nis some function of the final position of \n2\n. It depends upon where \n2\nis; if we go to some other point we get a different answer."

Solution: The kinetic plus potential energy must be a constant; when it \u201cleaves,\u201d it will be millions of miles away, and if it is just barely able to leave, we may suppose that it is moving with zero speed out there, just barely going. Let\na\nbe the radius of the earth, and\nM\nits mass. The kinetic plus potential energy is then initially given by \n1\n2\nm\nv\n2\n\u2212GmM/a\n. At the end of the motion the two energies must be equal. The kinetic energy is taken to be zero at the end of the motion, because it is supposed to be just barely drifting away at essentially zero speed, and the potential energy is\nGmM\ndivided by infinity, which is zero. So everything is zero on one side and that tells us that the square of the velocity must be \n2GM/a\n. But\nGM/\na\n2\nis what we call the acceleration of gravity,\ng\n. Thus\nv\n2\n=2ga.\n2"

The minimum of potential energy at \nr=d\nmeans this: if we start at \nd\nand move a small distance, a very small distance, the work done, which is the change in potential energy when we move this distance, is nearly zero, because there is very little change in potential energy at the bottom of the curve. Thus there is no force at this point, and so it is the equilibrium point. Another way to see that it is the equilibrium point is that it takes work to move away from \nd\nin either direction. When the two oxygen atoms have settled down, so that no more energy can be liberated from the force between them, they are in the lowest energy state, and they will be at this separation \nd\n. This is the way an oxygen molecule looks when it is cold. When we heat it up, the atoms shake and move farther apart, and we can in fact break them apart, but to do so takes a certain amount of work or energy, which is the potential energy difference between\nr=d\nand \nr=\u221e\n.

But the globular cluster as a whole is drifting in space too, and, if we were far enough away from it and did not see the details, could be thought of as a single object. Then if forces were applied to it, some of those forces might end up driving it forward as a whole, and we would see the center of the whole thing moving. On the other hand, some of the forces can be, so to speak, \u201cwasted\u201d in increasing the kinetic or potential energy of the \u201cparticles\u201d inside. Let us suppose, for instance, that the action of these forces expands the whole cluster and makes the particles move faster. The total energy of the whole thing is really conserved, but seen from the outside with our crude eyes which cannot see the confusion of motions inside, and just thinking of the kinetic energy of the motion of the whole object as though it were a single particle, it would appear that energy is not conserved, but this is due to a lack of appreciation of what it is that we see.

Thus the total potential-plus-kinetic energy inside the whole world is constant, and if the \u201cworld\u201d is a piece of isolated material, the energy is constant if there are no external forces. But as we have seen, some of the kinetic and potential energy of a thing may be internal, for instance the internal molecular motions, in the sense that we do not notice it. We know that in a glass of water everything is jiggling around, all the parts are moving all the time, so there is a certain kinetic energy inside, which we ordinarily may not pay any attention to. We do not notice the motion of the atoms, which produces heat, and so we do not call it kinetic energy, but heat is primarily kinetic energy. Internal potential energy may also be in the form, for instance, of chemical energy: when we burn gasoline energy is liberated because the potential energies of the atoms in the new atomic arrangement are lower than in the old arrangement. It is not strictly possible to treat heat as being pure kinetic energy, for a little of the potential gets in, and vice versa for chemical energy, so we put the two together and say that the total kinetic and potential energy inside an object is partly heat, partly chemical energy, and so on. Anyway, all these different forms of internal energy are sometimes considered as \u201clost\u201d energy in the sense described above; this will be made clearer when we study thermodynamics."

The result of this calculation is shown graphically in Fig. 14\u20134. It is negative, having the value zero at \nr=\u221e\nand varying as \n1/r\ndown to the radius \na\n, and then is constant inside the shell. Outside the shell the potential is \n\u2212Gm/r\n, where\nm\nis the mass of the shell, which is exactly the same as it would have been if all the mass were located at the center. But it is not everywhere exactly the same, for inside the shell the potential turns out to be \n\u2212Gm/a\n, and is a constant! When the potential is constant, there is no field, or when the potential energy is constant there is no force, because if we move an object from one place to another anywhere inside the sphere the work done by the force is exactly zero. Why? Because the work done in moving the object from one place to the other is equal to minus the change in the potential energy (or, the corresponding field integral is the change of the potential). But the potential energy is the same at any two points inside, so there is zero change in potential energy, and therefore no work is done in going between any two points inside the shell. The only way the work can be zero for all directions of displacement is that there is no force at all."

How can we calculate the\nx\n-component of the force? (If we can do this, of course, we can also find the\ny\n- and\nz\n-components, and we will then know the whole force.) Now, if we were to move the object a small distance \n\u0394x\n, the work done by the force on the object would be the\nx\n-component of the force times \n\u0394x\n, if\n\u0394x\nis sufficiently small, and this should equal the change in potential energy in going from one point to the other:\n\u0394W=\u2212\u0394U=\nF\nx\n\u0394x.\n(14.9)\nWe have merely used the formula \n\u222bF\u22c5ds=\u2212\u0394U\n, but for a very short path.

Instead of a \nd\nthey simply make a \u201cbackwards \n6\n,\u201d or \n\u2202\n. (A \n\u2202\nshould have been used in the beginning of calculus because we always want to cancel that \nd\n, but we never want to cancel a \n\u2202\n!) So they write \n\u2202U/\u2202x\n, and furthermore, in moments of duress, if they want to be very careful, they put a line beside it with a little \nyz\nat the bottom (\n\u2202U/\u2202x\n|\nyz\n), which means \u201cTake the derivative of \nU\nwith respect to \nx\n, keeping\ny\nand \nz\nconstant.\u201d Most often we leave out the remark about what is kept constant because it is usually evident from the context, so we usually do not use the line with the\ny\nand \nz\n. However, always use a \n\u2202\ninstead of a \nd\nas a warning that it is a derivative with some other variables kept constant.

It has the following \u201ccomponents\u201d: The\nx\n-component of this \u201cgrad\u201d is \n\u2202/\u2202x\n, the\ny\n-component is \n\u2202/\u2202y\n, and the\nz\n-component is \n\u2202/\u2202z\n, and then we have the fun of writing our formulas this way:\nF=\u2212\u2207U,C=\u2212\u2207\u03a8.\n(14.14)\nUsing\n\u2207\ngives us a quick way of testing whether we have a real vector equation or not, but actually Eqs.

In the case of electricity the force on a stationary object is the charge times the electric field: \nF=qE\n. (In general, of course, the\nx\n-component of force in an electrical problem has also a part which depends on the magnetic field. It is easy to show from Eq. (12.11) that the force on a particle due to magnetic fields is always at right angles to its velocity, and also at right angles to the field. Since the force due to magnetism on a moving charge is at right angles to the velocity, no work is done by the magnetism on the moving charge because the motion is at right angles to the force. Therefore, in calculating theorems of kinetic energy in electric and magnetic fields we can disregard the contribution from the magnetic field, since it does not change the kinetic energy.) We suppose that there is only an electric field. Then we can calculate the energy, or work done, in the same way as for gravity, and calculate a quantity \n\u03d5\nwhich is minus the integral of \nE\u22c5ds\n, from the arbitrary fixed point to the point where we make the calculation, and then the potential energy in an electric field is just charge times this quantity \n\u03d5\n:\n\u03d5(r)=\u2212\u222bE\u22c5ds,\nU=q\u03d5."
