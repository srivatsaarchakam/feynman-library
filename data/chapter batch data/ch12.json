What is the meaning of force, mass, and acceleration?\u201d Well, we can intuitively sense the meaning of mass, and we can define acceleration if we know the meaning of position and time. We shall not discuss those meanings, but shall concentrate on the new concept of force. The answer is equally simple: \u201cIf a body is accelerating, then there is a force on it.\u201d That is what Newton\u2019s laws say, so the most precise and beautiful definition of force imaginable might simply be to say that force is the mass of an object times the acceleration. Suppose we have a law which says that the conservation of momentum is valid if the sum of all the external forces is zero; then the question arises, \u201cWhat does it mean, that the sum of all the external forces is zero?\u201d A pleasant way to define that statement would be: \u201cWhen the total momentum is a constant, then the sum of the external forces is zero.\u201d There must be something wrong with that, because it is just not saying anything new. If we have discovered a fundamental law, which asserts that the force is equal to the mass times the acceleration, and then define the force to be the mass times the acceleration, we have found out nothing. We could also define force to mean that a moving object with no force acting on it continues to move with constant velocity in a straight line. If we then observe an object not moving in a straight line with a constant velocity, we might say that there is a force on it. Now such things certainly cannot be the content of physics, because they are definitions going in a circle. The Newtonian statement above, however, seems to be a most precise definition of force, and one that appeals to the mathematician; nevertheless, it is completely useless, because no prediction whatsoever can be made from a definition. One might sit in an armchair all day long and define words at will, but to find out what happens when two balls push against each other, or when a weight is hung on a spring, is another matter altogether, because the way the bodies behave is something completely outside any choice of definitions."

Now we have a wonderful new law, everything stands still except when a gorce is acting. You see, that would be analogous to the above definition of force, and it would contain no information. The real content of Newton\u2019s laws is this: that the force is supposed to have some independent properties, in addition to the law \nF=ma\n; but the specific independent properties that the force has were not completely described by Newton or by anybody else, and therefore the physical law \nF=ma\nis an incomplete law.

No, we are making an approximation; the cross hair has some width, but a geometrical line has no width, and so, whether Euclidean geometry can be used for surveying or not is a physical question, not a mathematical question. However, from an experimental standpoint, not a mathematical standpoint, we need to know whether the laws of Euclid apply to the kind of geometry that we use in measuring land; so we make a hypothesis that it does, and it works pretty well; but it is not precise, because our surveying lines are not really geometrical lines.

Not at all, because in the first place this law is an empirical thing that is obtained roughly by tests in a wind tunnel. You say, \u201cWell \nF=ma\nmight be empirical too.\u201d That is not the reason that there is a difference. The difference is not that it is empirical, but that, as we understand nature, this law is the result of an enormous complexity of events and is not, fundamentally, a simple thing. If we continue to study it more and more, measuring more and more accurately, the law will continue to become more complicated, not less. In other words, as we study this law of the drag on an airplane more and more closely, we find out that it is \u201cfalser\u201d and \u201cfalser,\u201d and the more deeply we study it, and the more accurately we measure, the more complicated the truth becomes; so in that sense we consider it not to result from a simple, fundamental process, which agrees with our original surmise. For example, if the velocity is extremely low, so low that an ordinary airplane is not flying, as when the airplane is dragged slowly through the air, then the law changes, and the drag friction depends more nearly linearly on the velocity. To take another example, the frictional drag on a ball or a bubble or anything that is moving slowly through a viscous liquid like honey, is proportional to the velocity, but for motion so fast that the fluid swirls around (honey does not but water and air do) then the drag becomes more nearly proportional to the square of the velocity (\nF=c\nv\n2\n), and if the velocity continues to increase, then even this law begins to fail. People who say, \u201cWell the coefficient changes slightly,\u201d are dodging the issue. Second, there are other great complications: can this force on the airplane be divided or analyzed as a force on the wings, a force on the front, and so on? Indeed, this can be done, if we are concerned about the torques here and there, but then we have to get special laws for the force on the wings, and so on. It is an amazing fact that the force on a wing depends upon the other wing: in other words, if we take the airplane apart and put just one wing in the air, then the force is not the same as if the rest of the plane were there. The reason, of course, is that some of the wind that hits the front goes around to the wings and changes the force on the wings. It seems a miracle that there is such a simple, rough, empirical law that can be used in the design of airplanes, but this law is not in the same class as the basic laws of physics, and further study of it will only make it more and more complicated. A study of how the coefficient \nc\ndepends on the shape of the front of the airplane is, to put it mildly, frustrating. There just is no simple law for determining the coefficient in terms of the shape of the airplane. In contrast, the law of gravitation is simple, and further study only indicates its greater simplicity."

                "data": "We have just discussed two cases of friction, resulting from fast movement in air and slow movement in honey. There is another kind of friction, called dry friction or sliding friction, which occurs when one solid body slides on another. In this case a force is needed to maintain motion. This is called a frictional force, and its origin, also, is a very complicated matter. Both surfaces of contact are irregular, on an atomic level. There are many points of contact where the atoms seem to cling together, and then, as the sliding body is pulled along, the atoms snap apart and vibration ensues; something like that has to happen. Formerly the mechanism of this friction was thought to be very simple, that the surfaces were merely full of irregularities and the friction originated in lifting the slider over the bumps; but this cannot be, for there is no loss of energy in that process, whereas power is in fact consumed. The mechanism of power loss is that as the slider snaps over the bumps, the bumps deform and then generate waves and atomic motions and, after a while, heat, in the two bodies. Now it is very remarkable that again, empirically, this friction can be described approximately by a simple law. This law is that the force needed to overcome friction and to drag one object over another depends upon the normal force (i.e., perpendicular to the surface) between the two surfaces that are in contact. Actually, to a fairly good approximation, the frictional force is proportional to this normal force, and has a more or less constant coefficient; that is,\nF=\u03bcN,\n(12.1)\nwhere\n\u03bc\nis called the coefficient of friction (Fig. 12\u20131). Although this coefficient is not exactly constant, the formula is a good empirical rule for judging approximately the amount of force that will be needed in certain practical or engineering circumstances. If the normal force or the speed of motion gets too big, the law fails because of the excessive heat generated. It is important to realize that each of these empirical laws has its limitations, beyond which it does not really work."

We set up a plane, inclined at a small angle \n\u03b8\n, and place a block of weight \nW\non the plane. We then tilt the plane at a steeper angle, until the block just begins to slide from its own weight. The component of the weight downward along the plane is \nWsin\u03b8\n, and this must equal the frictional force \nF\nwhen the block is sliding uniformly. The component of the weight normal to the plane is \nWcos\u03b8\n, and this is the normal force \nN\n. With these values, the formula becomes \nWsin\u03b8=\u03bcWcos\u03b8\n, from which we get\n\u03bc=\nsin\u03b8/cos\u03b8=\ntan\u03b8\n. If this law were exactly true, an object would start to slide at some definite inclination. If the same block is loaded by putting extra weight on it, then, although \nW\nis increased, all the forces in the formula are increased in the same proportion, and \nW\ncancels out. If\n\u03bc\nstays constant, the loaded block will slide again at the same slope. When the angle \n\u03b8\nis determined by trial with the original weight, it is found that with the greater weight the block will slide at about the same angle.

Molecular forces have never been satisfactorily explained on a basis of classical physics; it takes quantum mechanics to understand them fully. Empirically, however, the force between atoms is illustrated schematically in Fig. 12\u20132, where the force \nF\nbetween two atoms is plotted as a function of the distance \nr\nbetween them. There are different cases: in the water molecule, for example, the negative charges sit more on the oxygen, and the mean positions of the negative charges and of the positive charges are not at the same point; consequently, another molecule nearby feels a relatively large force, which is called a dipole-dipole force. However, for many systems the charges are very much better balanced, in particular for oxygen gas, which is perfectly symmetrical. In this case, although the minus charges and the plus charges are dispersed over the molecule, the distribution is such that the center of the minus charges and the center of the plus charges coincide. A molecule where the centers do not coincide is called a polar molecule, and charge times the separation between centers is called the dipole moment. A nonpolar molecule is one in which the centers of the charges coincide. For all nonpolar molecules, in which all the electrical forces are neutralized, it nevertheless turns out that the force at very large distances is an attraction and varies inversely as the seventh power of the distance, or \nF=k/\nr\n7\n, where\nk\nis a constant that depends on the molecules.

Therefore, in many circumstances, if the displacement is not too great the force is proportional to the displacement. This principle is known as Hooke\u2019s law, or the law of elasticity, which says that the force in a body which tries to restore the body to its original condition when it is distorted is proportional to the distortion. This law, of course, holds true only if the distortion is relatively small; when it gets too large the body will be torn apart or crushed, depending on the kind of distortion. The amount of force for which Hooke\u2019s law is valid depends upon the material; for instance, for dough or putty the force is very small, but for steel it is relatively large. Hooke\u2019s law can be nicely demonstrated with a long coil spring, made of steel and suspended vertically. A suitable weight hung on the lower end of the spring produces a tiny twist throughout the length of the wire, which results in a small vertical deflection in each turn and adds up to a large displacement if there are many turns. If the total elongation produced, say, by a\n100\n-gram weight, is measured, it is found that additional weights of\n100\n grams will each produce an additional elongation that is very nearly equal to the stretch that was measured for the first\n100\n grams. This constant ratio of force to displacement begins to change when the spring is overloaded, i.e., Hooke\u2019s law no longer holds."

We shall first discuss electrical force. Objects carry electrical charges which consist simply of electrons or protons. If any two bodies are electrically charged, there is an electrical force between them, and if the magnitudes of the charges are\nq\n1\nand \nq\n2\n, respectively, the force varies inversely as the square of the distance between the charges, or \nF=(const)\nq\n1\nq\n2\n/\nr\n2\n. For unlike charges, this law is like the law of gravitation, but for like charges the force is repulsive and the sign (direction) is reversed. The charges\nq\n1\nand \nq\n2\ncan be intrinsically either positive or negative, and in any specific application of the formula the direction of the force will come out right if the \nq\n\u2019s are given the proper plus or minus sign; the force is directed along the line between the two charges. The constant in the formula depends, of course, upon what units are used for the force, the charge, and the distance. In current practice the charge is measured in coulombs, the distance in meters, and the force in newtons. Then, in order to get the force to come out properly in newtons, the constant (which for historical reasons is written \n1/4\u03c0\n\u03f5\n0\n) takes the numerical value\n\u03f5\n0\n=8.854\u00d7\n10\n\u221212\n coul\n2\n/newton\u22c5\nm\n2\n2\nor\n1/4\u03c0\n\u03f5\n0\n=8.99\u00d7\n10\n9\n N\u22c5\nm\n2\n/\ncoul\n2\n.\n2\nThus the force law for static charges is\nF=\nq\n1\nq\n2\nr/4\u03c0\n\u03f5\n0\nr\n3\n.\n(12.2)\nIn nature, the most important charge of all is the charge on a single electron, which is\n1.60\u00d7\n10\n\u221219\n coulomb. In working with electrical forces between fundamental particles rather than with large charges, many people prefer the combination \n(\nq\nel\n)\n2\n/4\u03c0\n\u03f5\n0\n, in which\nq\nel\nis defined as the charge on an electron. This combination occurs frequently, and to simplify calculations it has been defined by the symbol \ne\n2\n; its numerical value in the mks system of units turns out to be \n(1.52\u00d7\n10\n\u221214\n)\n2\n. The advantage of using the constant in this form is that the force between two electrons in newtons can then be written simply as \ne\n2\n/\nr\n2\n, with\nr\nin meters, without all the individual constants. Electrical forces are much more complicated than this simple formula indicates, since the formula gives the force between two objects only when the objects are standing still.

Since at first sight the forces are very much more complicated than is indicated by the inverse-square laws and these laws hold true only when the interacting bodies are standing still, an improved method is needed to deal with the very complex forces that ensue when the bodies start to move in a complicated way. Experience has shown that an approach known as the concept of a \u201cfield\u201d is of great utility for the analysis of forces of this type. To illustrate the idea for, say, electrical force, suppose we have two electrical charges,\nq\n1\nand \nq\n2\n, located at points\nP\nand \nR\nrespectively. Then the force between the charges is given by\nF=\nq\n1\nq\n2\nr/4\u03c0\n\u03f5\n0\nr\n3\n.\n(12.3)\nTo analyze this force by means of the field concept, we say that the charge\nq\n1\nat \nP\nproduces a \u201ccondition\u201d at \nR\n, such that when the charge \nq\n2\nis placed at \nR\nit \u201cfeels\u201d the force. This is one way, strange perhaps, of describing it; we say that the force \nF\non\nq\n2\nat \nR\ncan be written in two parts. It is\nq\n2\nmultiplied by a quantity \nE\nthat would be there whether\nq\n2\nwere there or not (provided we keep all the other charges in their right places).\nE\nis the \u201ccondition\u201d produced by \nq\n1\n, we say, and\nF\nis the response of \nq\n2\nto \nE\n.\nE\nis called an electric field, and it is a vector. The formula for the electric field \nE\nthat is produced at \nR\nby a charge \nq\n1\nat \nP\nis the charge \nq\n1\ntimes the constant \n1/4\u03c0\n\u03f5\n0\ndivided by \nr\n2\n(\nr\nis the distance from\nP\nto \nR\n), and it is acting in the direction of the radius vector (the radius vector \nr\ndivided by its own length).

What is the point of all this? The point is to divide the analysis into two parts. One part says that something produces a field. The other part says that something is acted on by the field. By allowing us to look at the two parts independently, this separation of the analysis simplifies the calculation of a problem in many situations. If many charges are present, we first work out the total electric field produced at \nR\nby all the charges, and then, knowing the charge that is placed at \nR\n, we find the force on it."

One can do something like shake a charge and produce an effect, a field, at a distance; if one then stops moving the charge, the field keeps track of all the past, because the interaction between two particles is not instantaneous. It is desirable to have some way to remember what happened previously. If the force upon some charge depends upon where another charge was yesterday, which it does, then we need machinery to keep track of what went on yesterday, and that is the character of a field.

A spot of light glows in the center of the screen where the electrons strike, and this enables us to trace the electron path. On the way to the screen the electron beam passes through a narrow space between a pair of parallel metal plates, which are arranged, say, horizontally.

This particular illustration does not describe correctly the way in which Einstein\u2019s geometry is \u201cweird,\u201d but it illustrates that if we distort the geometry sufficiently it is possible that all gravitation is related in some way to pseudo forces; that is the general idea of the Einsteinian theory of gravitation."

                "data": "We conclude this chapter with a brief discussion of the only other known forces, which are called nuclear forces. These forces are within the nuclei of atoms, and although they are much discussed, no one has ever calculated the force between two nuclei, and indeed at present there is no known law for nuclear forces. These forces have a very tiny range which is just about the same as the size of the nucleus, perhaps\n10\n\u221213\n centimeter. With particles so small and at such a tiny distance, only the quantum-mechanical laws are valid, not the Newtonian laws. In nuclear analysis we no longer think in terms of forces, and in fact we can replace the force concept with a concept of the energy of interaction of two particles, a subject that will be discussed later. Any formula that can be written for nuclear forces is a rather crude approximation which omits many complications; one might be somewhat as follows: forces within a nucleus do not vary inversely as the square of the distance, but die off exponentially over a certain distance \nr\n, as expressed by \nF=(1/\nr\n2\n)exp(\u2212r/\nr\n0\n)\n, where the distance \nr\n0\nis of the order of\n10\n\u221213\n centimeter. In other words, the forces disappear as soon as the particles are any great distance apart, although they are very strong within the\n10\n\u221213\n centimeter range. So far as they are understood today, the laws of nuclear force are very complex; we do not understand them in any simple way, and the whole problem of analyzing the fundamental machinery behind nuclear forces is unsolved. Attempts at a solution have led to the discovery of numerous strange particles, the\n\u03c0\n-mesons, for example, but the origin of these forces remains obscure."
