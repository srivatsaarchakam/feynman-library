Now let us look into this further and see whether it can be generalized, and thus advance our understanding. Does it work only for a freely falling body, or is it more general? We expect from our discussion of the conservation of energy that it would work for an object moving from one point to another in some kind of frictionless curve, under the influence of gravity (Fig. 13\u20131). If the object reaches a certain height \nh\nfrom the original height \nH\n, then the same formula should again be right, even though the velocity is now in some direction other than the vertical. We would like to understand why the law is still correct. Let us follow the same analysis, finding the time rate of change of the kinetic energy. This will again be \nmv(dv/dt)\n, but\nm(dv/dt)\nis the rate of change of the magnitude of the momentum, i.e., the force in the direction of motion\u2014the tangential force \nF\nt\n. Thus\ndT\ndt\n=mv\ndv\ndt\n=\nF\nt\nv.\nd\nT\nd\nNow the speed is the rate of change of distance along the curve,\nds/dt\n, and the tangential force \nF\nt\nis not \n\u2212mg\nbut is weaker by the ratio of the vertical distance \ndh\nto the distance \nds\nalong the path. In other words,\nF\nt\n=\u2212mgsin\u03b8=\u2212mg\ndh\nds\n,\nd\nh\nso that\nF\nt\nds\ndt\n=\u2212mg(\ndh\nds\n)(\nds\ndt\n)=\u2212mg\ndh\ndt\n,\nd\n(\nd\nh\n)\n(\nd\n)\nd\nh\nsince the\nds\n\u2019s cancel.

It means that if an object is moving in any way under the influence of a force, moving in some kind of curved path, then the change in K.E. when it goes from one point to another along the curve is equal to the integral of the component of the force along the curve times the differential displacement \nds\n, the integral being carried out from one point to the other. This integral also has a name; it is called the work done by the force on the object. We see immediately that power equals work done per second. We also see that it is only a component of force in the direction of motion that contributes to the work done. In our simple example the forces were only vertical, and had only a single component, say \nF\nz\n, equal to \n\u2212mg\n. No matter how the object moves in those circumstances, falling in a parabola for example,\nF\u22c5s\n, which can be written as \nF\nx\ndx+\nF\ny\ndy+\nF\nz\ndz\n, has nothing left of it but \nF\nz\ndz=\u2212mgdz\n, because the other components of force are zero.

Consider an object which initially has kinetic energy and is moving very fast, and which slides against the floor with friction. It stops. At the start the kinetic energy is not zero, but at the end it is zero; there is work done by the forces, because whenever there is friction there is always a component of force in a direction opposite to that of the motion, and so energy is steadily lost. But now let us take a mass on the end of a pivot swinging in a vertical plane in a gravitational field with no friction. What happens here is different, because when the mass is going up the force is downward, and when it is coming down, the force is also downward. Thus\nF\u22c5ds\nhas one sign going up and another sign coming down. At each corresponding point of the downward and upward paths the values of \nF\u22c5ds\nare exactly equal in size but of opposite sign, so the net result of the integral will be zero for this case. Thus the kinetic energy with which the mass comes back to the bottom is the same as it had when it left; that is the principle of the conservation of energy. (Note that when there are friction forces the conservation of energy seems at first sight to be invalid. We have to find another form of energy. It turns out, in fact, that heat is generated in an object when it rubs another with friction, but at the moment we supposedly do not know that.)"

Can we design the curve so that it comes back moving a little bit faster than it did before, so that it goes around and around and around, and gives us perpetual motion? Since perpetual motion is impossible, we ought to find out that this is also impossible. We ought to discover the following proposition: since there is no friction the object should come back with neither higher nor lower velocity\u2014it should be able to keep going around and around any closed path. Stated in another way, the total work done in going around a complete cycle should be zero for gravity forces, because if it is not zero we can get energy out by going around. (If the work turns out to be less than zero, so that we get less speed when we go around one way, then we merely go around the other way, because the forces, of course, depend only upon the position, not upon the direction; if one way is plus, the other way would be minus, so unless it is zero we will get perpetual motion by going around either way.)"

First of all, we might like to assert that a real curve could always be imitated sufficiently well by a series of sawtooth jiggles like those of Fig. 13\u20134, and that therefore, etc., Q.E.D., but without a little analysis, it is not obvious at first that the work done going around even a small triangle is zero. Let us magnify one of the triangles, as shown in Fig. 13\u20134. Is the work done in going from\na\nto \nb\nand\nb\nto \nc\non a triangle the same as the work done in going directly from\na\nto \nc\n? Suppose that the force is acting in a certain direction; let us take the triangle such that the side \nbc\nis in this direction, just as an example. We also suppose that the triangle is so small that the force is essentially constant over the entire triangle. What is the work done in going from\na\nto \nc\n? It is\nW\nac\n=\n\u222b\nc\na\nF\u22c5ds=Fscos\u03b8,\nc\nsince the force is constant. Now let us calculate the work done in going around the other two sides of the triangle. On the vertical side \nab\nthe force is perpendicular to \nds\n, so that here the work is zero. On the horizontal side \nbc\n,\nW\nbc\n=\n\u222b\nc\nb\nF\u22c5ds=Fx.\nc\nThus we see that the work done in going along the sides of a small triangle is the same as that done going on a slant, because\nscos\u03b8\nis equal to \nx\n. We have proved previously that the answer is zero for any path composed of a series of notches like those of Fig. 13\u20133, and also that we do the same work if we cut across the corners instead of going along the notches (so long as the notches are fine enough, and we can always make them very fine); therefore, the work done in going around any path in a gravitational field is zero."

It tells us that when a planet moves around the sun (without any other objects around, no other forces) it moves in such a manner that the square of the speed at any point minus some constants divided by the radius at that point is always the same at every point on the orbit. For example, the closer the planet is to the sun, the faster it is going, but by how much? By the following amount: if instead of letting the planet go around the sun, we were to change the direction (but not the magnitude) of its velocity and make it move radially, and then we let it fall from some special radius to the radius of interest, the new speed would be the same as the speed it had in the actual orbit, because this is just another example of a complicated path. So long as we come back to the same distance, the kinetic energy will be the same. So, whether the motion is the real, undisturbed one, or is changed in direction by channels, by frictionless constraints, the kinetic energy with which the planet arrives at a point will be the same."

When we displace the mass from its balanced position, the restoring force is proportional to the displacement. In those circumstances, can we work out a law for conservation of energy? Yes, because the work done by such a force is\nW=\n\u222b\nx\n0\nFdx=\n\u222b\nx\n0\n\u2212kxdx=\u2212\n1\n2\nk\nx\n2\n.\n(13.13)\nTherefore, for a mass on a spring we have that the kinetic energy of the oscillating mass plus \n1\n2\nk\nx\n2\nis a constant. Let us see how this works. We pull the mass down; it is standing still and so its speed is zero. But\nx\nis not zero,\nx\nis at its maximum, so there is some energy, the potential energy, of course. Now we release the mass and things begin to happen (the details not to be discussed), but at any instant the kinetic plus potential energy must be a constant. For example, after the mass is on its way past the original equilibrium point, the position \nx\nequals zero, but that is when it has its biggest \nv\n2\n, and as it gets more\nx\n2\nit gets less \nv\n2\n, and so on. So the balance of\nx\n2\nand \nv\n2\nis maintained as the mass goes up and down. Thus we have another rule now, that the potential energy for a spring is \n1\n2\nk\nx\n2\n, if the force is \n\u2212kx\n."

Thus the particle pair\n1\nand \n3\ncontributes only one term to the sum. To keep track of this, we might agree to let\ni\nrange over all values\n1\n, \n2\n,\n3\n, \u2026, and for each\ni\nlet\nj\nrange only over values greater than\ni\n. Thus if\ni=3\n,\nj\ncould only have values\n4\n, \n5\n,\n6\n, \u2026 But we notice that for each\ni,j\n value there are two contributions to the sum, one involving\nv\ni\n, and the other\nv\nj\n, and that these terms have the same appearance as those of Eq. (13.15), where all values of\ni\nand \nj\n(except\ni=j\n) are included in the sum. Therefore, by matching the terms one by one, we see that Eqs. (13.16) and (13.15) are precisely the same, but of opposite sign, so that the time derivative of the kinetic plus potential energy is indeed zero. Thus we see that, for many objects, the kinetic energy is the sum of the contributions from each individual object, and that the potential energy is also simple, it being also just a sum of contributions, the energies between all the pairs. We can understand why it should be the energy of every pair this way: Suppose that we want to find the total amount of work that must be done to bring the objects to certain distances from each other. We may do this in several steps, bringing them in from infinity where there is no force, one by one. First we bring in number one, which requires no work, since no other objects are yet present to exert force on it. Next we bring in number two, which does take some work, namely \nW\n12\n=\u2212G\nm\n1\nm\n2\n/\nr\n12\n. Now, and this is an important point, suppose we bring in the next object to position three. At any moment the force on number \n3\ncan be written as the sum of two forces\u2014the force exerted by number \n1\nand that exerted by number \n2\n. Therefore the work done is the sum of the works done by each, because if \nF\n3\ncan be resolved into the sum of two forces,\nF\n3\n=\nF\n13\n+\nF\n23\n,\nF\nF\nF\nthen the work is\n\u222b\nF\n3\n\u22c5ds=\u222b\nF\n13\n\u22c5ds+\u222b\nF\n23\n\u22c5ds=\nW\n13\n+\nW\n23\n.\n\u222b\n\u222b\n\u222b\nThat is, the work done is the sum of the work done against the first force and the second force, as if each acted independently. Proceeding in this way, we see that the total work required to assemble the given configuration of objects is precisely the value given in Eq. (13.14) as the potential energy. It is because gravity obeys the principle of superposition of forces that we can write the potential energy as a sum over each pair of particles."

                "data": "Now we shall calculate the fields which are met in a few physical circumstances involving distributions of mass. We have not so far considered distributions of mass, only particles, so it is interesting to calculate the forces when they are produced by more than just one particle. First we shall find the gravitational force on a mass that is produced by a plane sheet of material, infinite in extent. The force on a unit mass at a given point \nP\n, produced by this sheet of material (Fig. 13\u20135), will of course be directed toward the sheet. Let the distance of the point from the sheet be \na\n, and let the amount of mass per unit area of this huge sheet be \n\u03bc\n. We shall suppose\n\u03bc\nto be constant; it is a uniform sheet of material. Now, what small field \ndC\nis produced by the mass \ndm\nlying between\n\u03c1\nand \n\u03c1+d\u03c1\nfrom the point \nO\nof the sheet nearest point \nP\n? Answer: \ndC=\u2212G(dmr/\nr\n3\n)\n. But this field is directed along \nr\n, and we know that only the\nx\n-component of it will remain when we add all the little vector \ndC\n\u2019s to produce \nC\n. The\nx\n-component of \ndC\nis\nd\nC\nx\n=\u2212G\ndm\nr\nx\nr\n3\n=\u2212G\ndma\nr\n3\n.\nd\nd\nNow all masses \ndm\nwhich are at the same distance \nr\nfrom \nP\nwill yield the same \nd\nC\nx\n, so we may at once write for \ndm\nthe total mass in the ring between\n\u03c1\nand \n\u03c1+d\u03c1\n, namely\ndm=\u03bc2\u03c0\u03c1d\u03c1\n(\n2\u03c0\u03c1d\u03c1\nis the area of a ring of radius \n\u03c1\nand width \nd\u03c1\n, if\nd\u03c1\u226a\u03c1\n). Thus\nd\nC\nx\n=\u2212G\u03bc2\u03c0\u03c1\nd\u03c1a\nr\n3\n.\nd\nThen, since\nr\n2\n=\n\u03c1\n2\n+\na\n2\n,\n\u03c1d\u03c1=rdr\n. Therefore,\nC\nx\n=\u22122\u03c0G\u03bca\n\u222b\n\u221e\na\ndr\nr\n2\n=\u22122\u03c0G\u03bca(\n1\na\n\u2212\n1\n\u221e\n)=\u22122\u03c0G\u03bc.\n(13.17)\nThus the force is independent of distance \na\n! Why? Have we made a mistake? One might think that the farther away we go, the weaker the force would be. But no! If we are close, most of the matter is pulling at an unfavorable angle; if we are far away, more of the matter is situated more favorably to exert a pull toward the plane. At any distance, the matter which is most effective lies in a certain cone. When we are farther away the force is smaller by the inverse square, but in the same cone, in the same angle, there is much more matter, larger by just the square of the distance! This analysis can be made rigorous by just noticing that the differential contribution in any given cone is in fact independent of the distance, because of the reciprocal variation of the strength of the force from a given mass, and the amount of mass included in the cone, with changing distance. The force is not really constant of course, because when we go on the other side of the sheet it is reversed in sign."
