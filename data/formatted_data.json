You see, the molecules in a gas are separated from one another, and they're constantly bouncing around and colliding with the walls of their container. If you were to imagine a room filled with tennis balls bouncing in perpetual motion, that's what it's like on a tiny scale. When these molecules bombard the walls, they push them away, and we'd have to push the walls back to keep them in place. This means that the gas exerts a jittery force, which we can only feel as an average push."

You see, it doesn't matter what the shapes of the molecules are, so for simplicity, let's just think of them as tennis balls or little dots. These molecules are in perpetual motion, moving in all directions, and they're constantly colliding with the walls of their container. To keep the container from being knocked away by this continuous banging, we have to hold it down with a certain force, which we call the pressure."

And since each collision is just as 'energetic' as before, the pressure is going to be proportional to the density. However, if we were to consider the true nature of the forces between the atoms, there might be a slight decrease or increase in pressure. But, if the density is low enough, we can say that the pressure is proportional to the density."

You can try this yourself by bouncing a ping-pong ball off a forward-moving paddle, and you'll notice that it comes off with more speed than it had before.
