        "output": "Feynman was born on May 11, 1918, in New York City,[2]to Lucille (néePhillips; 1895–1981), ahomemaker, and Melville Arthur Feynman (1890–1946), a sales manager.[3]Feynman's father was born into aJewish familyinMinsk,Russian Empire,[4]and emigrated with his parents to the United States at the age of five. Feynman's mother was born in the United States into a Jewish family. Lucille's father had emigrated from Poland, and her mother also came from a family of Polish immigrants. She trained as a primary school teacher but married Melville in 1917, before taking up a profession.[2][3]Feynman was alate talkerand did not speak until after his third birthday. As an adult, he spoke with aNew York accent[5][6]strong enough to be perceived as an affectation or exaggeration,[7][8]so much so that his friendsWolfgang PauliandHans Betheonce commented that Feynman spoke like a \"bum\".[7] The young Feynman was heavily influenced by his father, who encouraged him to ask questions to challenge orthodox thinking, and who was always ready to teach Feynman something new. From his mother, he gained the sense of humor that he had throughout his life. As a child, he had a talent for engineering,[9]maintained an experimental laboratory in his home, and delighted in repairing radios. This radio repairing was probably the first job Feynman had, and during this time he showed early signs of an aptitude for his later career in theoretical physics, when he would analyze the issues theoretically and arrive at the solutions.[10]When he was in grade school, he created a home burglar alarm system while his parents were out for the day running errands.[11] When Richard was five, his mother gave birth to a younger brother, Henry Phillips, who died at age four weeks.[12]Four years later, Richard's sisterJoanwas born and the family moved toFar Rockaway, Queens.[3]Though separated by nine years, Joan and Richard were close, and they both shared a curiosity about the world.[13]Though their mother thought women lacked the capacity to understand such things, Richard encouraged Joan's interest in astronomy, and Joan eventually became an astrophysicist.[14]"

His appointment was not extended when he did not commit to returning. In a talk given there several years later, Feynman quipped, \"It's great to be back at the only university that ever had the good sense to fire me.\"[80] As early as October 30, 1943, Bethe had written to the chairman of the physics department of his university,Cornell, to recommend that Feynman be hired. On February 28, 1944, this was endorsed byRobert Bacher,[81]also from Cornell,[82]and one of the most senior scientists at Los Alamos.[83]This led to an offer being made in August 1944, which Feynman accepted. Oppenheimer had also hoped to recruit Feynman to the University of California, but the head of the physics department,Raymond T. Birge, was reluctant. He made Feynman an offer in May 1945, but Feynman turned it down. Cornell matched its salary offer of $3,900 (equivalent to $66,000 in 2023) per annum.[81]Feynman became one of the first of the Los Alamos Laboratory's group leaders to depart, leaving forIthaca, New York, in October 1945.[84] Because Feynman was no longer working at the Los Alamos Laboratory, he was no longer exempt fromthe draft. At his induction physical, Army psychiatrists diagnosed Feynman as suffering from a mental illness and the Army gave him a4-F exemptionon mental grounds.[85][86]His father died suddenly on October 8, 1946, and Feynman suffered from depression.[87]On October 17, 1946, he wrote a letter to Arline, expressing his deep love and heartbreak. The letter was sealed and only opened after his death. \"Please excuse my not mailing this,\" the letter concluded, \"but I don't know your new address.\"[88]Unable to focus on research problems, Feynman began tackling physics problems, not for utility, but for self-satisfaction.[87]One of these involved analyzing the physics of a twirling,nutatingdisk as it is moving through the air, inspired by an incident in the cafeteria at Cornell when someone tossed a dinner plate in the air.[89]He read the work of SirWilliam Rowan Hamiltononquaternions, and tried unsuccessfully to use them to formulate arelativistictheory of electrons. His work during this period, which used equations of rotation to express various spinning speeds, ultimately proved important to his Nobel Prize–winning work, yet because he felt burned out and had turned his attention to less immediately practical problems, he was surprised by the offers of professorships from other renowned universities, including theInstitute for Advanced Study, theUniversity of California, Los Angeles, and theUniversity of California, Berkeley.[87] Feynman was not the only frustrated theoretical physicist in the early post-war years.Quantum electrodynamicssuffered frominfiniteintegrals inperturbation theory. These were clear mathematical flaws in the theory, which Feynman and Wheeler had tried, unsuccessfully, to work around.[90]\"Theoreticians\", notedMurray Gell-Mann, \"were in disgrace\".[91]In June 1947, leading American physicists met at theShelter Island Conference. For Feynman, it was his \"first big conference with big men ... I had never gone to one like this one in peacetime.\"[92]The problems plaguing quantum electrodynamics were discussed, but the theoreticians were completely overshadowed by the achievements of the experimentalists, who reported the discovery of theLamb shift, the measurement of themagnetic momentof the electron, andRobert Marshak'stwo-mesonhypothesis.[93] Bethe took the lead from the work ofHans Kramers, and derived arenormalizednon-relativistic quantum equation for the Lamb shift. The next step was to create a relativistic version. Feynman thought that he could do this, but when he went back to Bethe with his solution, it did not converge.[94]Feynman carefully worked through the problem again, applying the path integral formulation that he had used in his thesis. Like Bethe, he made the integral finite by applying a cut-off term. The result corresponded to Bethe's version.[95][96]Feynman presented his work to his peers at thePocono Conferencein 1948. It did not go well.Julian Schwingergave a long presentation of his work in quantum electrodynamics, and Feynman then offered his version, entitled \"Alternative Formulation of Quantum Electrodynamics\". The unfamiliarFeynman diagrams, used for the first time, puzzled the audience. Feynman failed to get his point across, andPaul Dirac,Edward Tellerand Niels Bohr all raised objections.[97][98] ToFreeman Dyson, one thing at least was clear:Shin'ichirō Tomonaga, Schwinger and Feynman understood what they were talking about even if no one else did, but had not published anything. He was convinced that Feynman's formulation was easier to understand, and ultimately managed to convince Oppenheimer that this was the case.[99]Dyson published a paper in 1949, which added new rules to Feynman's that told how to implement renormalization.[100]Feynman was prompted to publish his ideas in thePhysical Reviewin a series of papers over three years.[101]His 1948 papers on \"A Relativistic Cut-Off for Classical Electrodynamics\" attempted to explain what he had been unable to get across at Pocono.[102]His 1949 paper on \"The Theory of Positrons\" addressed theSchrödinger equationandDirac equation, and introduced what is now called theFeynman propagator.[103]Finally, in papers on the \"Mathematical Formulation of the Quantum Theory of Electromagnetic Interaction\" in 1950 and \"An Operator Calculus Having Applications in Quantum Electrodynamics\" in 1951, he developed the mathematical basis of his ideas, derived familiar formulae and advanced new ones.[104] While papers by others initially cited Schwinger, papers citing Feynman and employing Feynman diagrams appeared in 1950, and soon became prevalent.[105]Students learned and used the powerful new tool that Feynman had created. Computer programs were later written to evaluate Feynman diagrams, enabling physicists to use quantum field theory to makehigh-precision predictions.[106]Marc Kacadapted Feynman's technique of summing over possible histories of a particle to the study ofparabolic partial differential equations, yielding what is now known as theFeynman–Kac formula, the use of which extends beyond physics to many applications ofstochastic processes.[107]To Schwinger, however, the Feynman diagram was \"pedagogy, not physics\".[108] By 1949, Feynman was becoming restless at Cornell. He never settled into a particular house or apartment, living in guest houses or student residences, or with married friends \"until these arrangements became sexually volatile\".[109]He liked to date undergraduates, hire prostitutes, and sleep with the wives of friends.[110]He was not fond of Ithaca's cold winter weather, and pined for a warmer climate.[111]Above all, he was always in the shadow of Hans Bethe at Cornell.[109]Despite all of this, Feynman looked back favorably on theTelluride House, where he resided for a large period of his Cornell career. In an interview, he described the House as \"a group of boys that have been specially selected because of their scholarship, because of their cleverness or whatever it is, to be given free board and lodging and so on, because of their brains\". He enjoyed the house's convenience and said that \"it's there that I did the fundamental work\" for which he won the Nobel Prize.[112][113]"

He saw that it contained the original text in a little square on the page, and surrounding it were commentaries written over time by different people. In this way the Talmud had evolved, and everything that was discussed was carefully recorded. Despite being impressed, Feynman was disappointed with the lack of interest for nature and the outside world expressed by the rabbis, who cared about only those questions which arise from the Talmud.[19]"

        "input": "Pedagogy",
        "output": "In the early 1960s, Feynman acceded to a request to \"spruce up\" the teaching of undergraduates at the California Institute of Technology, also called Caltech. After three years devoted to the task, he produced a series of lectures that later becameThe Feynman Lectures on Physics. Accounts vary about how successful the original lectures were. Feynman's own preface, written just after an exam on which the students did poorly, was somewhat pessimistic. His colleaguesDavid L. GoodsteinandGerry Neugebauersaid later that the intended audience of first-year students found the material intimidating while older students and faculty found it inspirational, so the lecture hall remained full even as the first-year students dropped away. In contrast, physicist Matthew Sands recalled the student attendance as being typical for a large lecture course.[161] Converting the lectures into books occupiedMatthew SandsandRobert B. Leightonas part-time co-authors for several years. Feynman suggested that the book cover should have a picture of a drum with mathematical diagrams about vibrations drawn upon it, in order to illustrate the application of mathematics to understanding the world. Instead, the publishers gave the books plain red covers, though they included a picture of Feynman playing drums in the foreword.[162]Even though the books were not adopted by universities as textbooks, they continue to sell well because they provide a deep understanding of physics.[163] Many of Feynman's lectures and miscellaneous talks were turned into other books, includingThe Character of Physical Law,QED: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter,Statistical Mechanics,Lectures on Gravitation, and theFeynman Lectures on Computation.[164] Feynman wrote about his experiences teaching physics undergraduates inBrazil. The students' studying habits and the Portuguese language textbooks were so devoid of any context or applications for their information that, in Feynman's opinion, the students were not learning physics at all. At the end of the year, Feynman was invited to give a lecture on his teaching experiences, and he agreed to do so, provided he could speak frankly, which he did.[165][166] Feynman opposedrote learning, or unthinkingmemorization, as well as otherteaching methodsthat emphasized form over function. In his mind,clear thinkingandclear presentationwere fundamental prerequisites for hisattention. It could be perilous even to approach him unprepared, and he did not forget fools and pretenders.[167] In 1964, he served on the California State Curriculum Commission, which was responsible for approvingtextbooksto be used by schools inCalifornia. He was not impressed with what he found.[168]Many of the mathematics texts covered subjects of use only topure mathematiciansas part of the \"New Math\". Elementary students were taught aboutsets, but: In April 1966, Feynman delivered an address to theNational Science Teachers Association, in which he suggested howstudentscould be made to think likescientists, be open-minded, curious, and especially, todoubt. In the course of the lecture, he gave a definition of science, which he said came about by several stages. The evolution ofintelligentlife on planet Earth—creatures such as cats that play and learn from experience. The evolution of humans, who came to use language to pass knowledge from one individual to the next, so that the knowledge was not lost when an individual died. Unfortunately, incorrectknowledgecould be passed down as well as correct knowledge, so another step was needed.Galileoand others started doubting the truth of what was passed down and to investigateab initio, from experience, what the true situation was—this was science.[170] In 1974, Feynman delivered the Caltech commencement address on the topic ofcargo cult science, which has the semblance of science, but is onlypseudosciencedue to a lack of \"a kind of scientific integrity, a principle of scientific thought that corresponds to a kind of utter honesty\" on the part of the scientist. He instructed the graduating class that \"The first principle is that you must not fool yourself—and you are the easiest person to fool. So you have to be very careful about that. After you've not fooled yourself, it's easy not to fool other scientists. You just have to be honest in a conventional way after that.\"[171] Feynman served as doctoral advisor to 30 students.[172]"

During a break in one hearing, Rogers told commission memberNeil Armstrong, \"Feynman is becoming a pain in the ass.\"[182] During a televised hearing, Feynman demonstrated that the material used in the shuttle'sO-ringsbecame less resilient in cold weather by compressing a sample of the material in a clamp and immersing it in ice-cold water.[183]The commission ultimately determined that the disaster was caused by the primary O-ring not properly sealing in unusually cold weather atCape Canaveral.[184] Feynman devoted the latter half of his 1988 bookWhat Do You Care What Other People Think?to his experience on the Rogers Commission, straying from his usual convention of brief, light-hearted anecdotes to deliver an extended and sober narrative. Feynman's account reveals a disconnect betweenNASA's engineers and executives that was far more striking than he expected. His interviews of NASA's high-ranking managers revealed startling misunderstandings of elementary concepts. For instance, NASA managers claimed that there was a 1 in 100,000 probability of a catastrophic failure aboard the Shuttle, but Feynman discovered that NASA's own engineers estimated the probability of a catastrophe at closer to 1 in 200. He concluded that NASA management's estimate of the reliability of the Space Shuttle was unrealistic, and he was particularly angered that NASA used it to recruitChrista McAuliffeinto the Teacher-in-Space program. He warned in his appendix to the commission's report (which was included only after he threatened not to sign the report), \"For a successful technology, reality must take precedence over public relations, for nature cannot be fooled.\"[185]"

An IQ test administered in high school estimated hisIQat 125—high but \"merely respectable\", according to biographerJames Gleick.[21][22]His sister Joan, who scored one point higher, later jokingly claimed to an interviewer that she was smarter. Years later he declined to joinMensa International, saying that his IQ was too low.[23] When Feynman was 15, he taught himselftrigonometry,advanced algebra,infinite series,analytic geometry, and bothdifferentialandintegral calculus.[24]Before entering college, he was experimenting with mathematical topics such as thehalf-derivativeusing his own notation.[25]He created special symbols forlogarithm,sine,cosineandtangentfunctions so they did not look like three variables multiplied together, and for thederivative, to remove the temptation of canceling out thed{\\displaystyle d}'s ind/dx{\\displaystyle d/dx}.[26][27]A member of theArista Honor Society, in his last year in high school he won theNew York UniversityMath Championship.[28]His habit of direct characterization sometimes rattled more conventional thinkers; for example, one of his questions, when learningfeline anatomy, was \"Do you have a map of the cat?\" (referring to an anatomical chart).[29] Feynman applied toColumbia Universitybut was not accepted because of itsquota for the number of Jews admitted.[3]Instead, he attended theMassachusetts Institute of Technology, where he joined thePi Lambda Phifraternity.[30]Although he originally majored in mathematics, he later switched to electrical engineering, as he considered mathematics to be too abstract. Noticing that he \"had gone too far\", he then switched to physics, which he claimed was \"somewhere in between\".[31]As an undergraduate, he published two papers in thePhysical Review.[28]One of these, which was co-written withManuel Vallarta, was entitled \"The Scattering of Cosmic Rays by the Stars of a Galaxy\".[32] The other was his senior thesis, on \"Forces in Molecules\",[34]based on a topic assigned byJohn C. Slater, who was sufficiently impressed by the paper to have it published. Its main result is known as theHellmann–Feynman theorem.[35] In 1939, Feynman received abachelor's degree[36]and was named aPutnam Fellow.[37]He attained a perfect score on the graduate school entrance exams toPrinceton Universityin physics—an unprecedented feat—and an outstanding score in mathematics, but did poorly on the history and English portions. The head of the physics department there,Henry D. Smyth, had another concern, writing toPhilip M. Morseto ask: \"Is Feynman Jewish? We have no definite rule against Jews but have to keep their proportion in our department reasonably small because of the difficulty of placing them.\"[38]Morse conceded that Feynman was indeed Jewish, but reassured Smyth that Feynman's \"physiognomy and manner, however, show no trace of this characteristic\".[38] Attendees at Feynman's first seminar, which was on the classical version of theWheeler–Feynman absorber theory, includedAlbert Einstein,Wolfgang Pauli, andJohn von Neumann. Pauli made the prescient comment that the theory would be extremely difficult to quantize, and Einstein said that one might try to apply this method to gravity ingeneral relativity,[39]whichSir Fred HoyleandJayant Narlikardid much later as theHoyle–Narlikar theory of gravity.[40][41]Feynman received a PhD from Princeton in 1942; his thesis advisor wasJohn Archibald Wheeler.[42]In his doctoral thesis entitled \"The Principle of Least Action in Quantum Mechanics\",[43]Feynman applied theprinciple of stationary actionto problems of quantum mechanics, inspired by a desire to quantize the Wheeler–Feynman absorber theory of electrodynamics, and laid the groundwork for the path integral formulation and Feynman diagrams.[44]A key insight was thatpositronsbehaved likeelectronsmoving backwards in time.[44]James Gleick wrote: One of the conditions of Feynman's scholarship to Princeton was that he could not be married; nevertheless, he continued to see his high school sweetheart, Arline Greenbaum, and was determined to marry her once he had been awarded his PhD despite the knowledge that she was seriously ill withtuberculosis. This was an incurable disease at the time, and she was not expected to live more than two years. On June 29, 1942, they took theferrytoStaten Island, where they were married in the city office. The ceremony was attended by neither family nor friends and was witnessed by a pair of strangers. Feynman could kiss Arline only on the cheek. After the ceremony he took her toDeborah Hospital, where he visited her on weekends.[45][46]"

Wilson, who was working on means to produceenriched uraniumfor use in anatomic bomb, as part of what would become theManhattan Project.[49][50]At the time, Feynman had not earned a graduate degree.[51]Wilson's team at Princeton was working on a device called an isotron, intended to electromagnetically separateuranium-235fromuranium-238. This was done in a quite different manner from that used by thecalutronthat was under development by a team under Wilson's former mentor,Ernest O. Lawrence, at theRadiation Laboratoryof theUniversity of California. On paper, the isotron was many times more efficient than the calutron, but Feynman andPaul Olumstruggled to determine whether it was practical. Ultimately, on Lawrence's recommendation, the isotron project was abandoned.[52] At this juncture, in early 1943,Robert Oppenheimerwas establishing theLos Alamos Laboratory, a secret laboratory on amesainNew Mexicowhere atomic bombs would be designed and built. An offer was made to the Princeton team to be redeployed there. \"Like a bunch of professional soldiers,\" Wilson later recalled, \"we signed up, en masse, to go to Los Alamos.\"[53]Like many other young physicists, Feynman soon fell under the spell of the charismatic Oppenheimer, who telephoned Feynman long distance from Chicago to inform him that he had found a PresbyteriansanatoriuminAlbuquerque, New Mexicofor Arline. They were among the first to depart for New Mexico, leaving on a train on March 28, 1943. The railroad supplied Arline with a wheelchair, and Feynman paid extra for a private room for her. There they spent their wedding anniversary.[54] At Los Alamos, Feynman was assigned to Hans Bethe's Theoretical (T) Division,[55]and impressed Bethe enough to be made a group leader.[56]He and Bethe developed theBethe–Feynman formulafor calculating the yield of afission bomb, which built upon previous work byRobert Serber.[57]As a junior physicist, he was not central to the project. He administered the computation group ofhuman computersin the theoretical division. WithStanley FrankelandNicholas Metropolis, he assisted in establishing a system for usingIBMpunched cardsfor computation.[58]He invented a new method of computinglogarithmsthat he later used on theConnection Machine.[59][60]An avid drummer, Feynman figured out how to get the machine to click in musical rhythms.[61] Other work at Los Alamos included calculatingneutronequations for the Los Alamos \"Water Boiler\", a smallnuclear reactor, to measure how close an assembly of fissile material was to criticality.[62] On completing this work, Feynman was sent to theClinton Engineer WorksinOak Ridge, Tennessee, where the Manhattan Project had itsuranium enrichmentfacilities. He aided the engineers there in devising safety procedures for material storage so thatcriticality accidentscould be avoided, especially whenenriched uraniumcame into contact with water, which acted as aneutron moderator. He insisted on giving the rank and file a lecture on nuclear physics so that they would realize the dangers.[63]He explained that while any amount of unenriched uranium could be safely stored, the enriched uranium had to be carefully handled. He developed a series of safety recommendations for the various grades of enrichments.[64]He was told that if the people at Oak Ridge gave him any difficulty with his proposals, he was to inform them that Los Alamos \"could not be responsible for their safety otherwise\".[65] Returning to Los Alamos, Feynman was put in charge of the group responsible for the theoretical work and calculations on the proposeduranium hydride bomb, which ultimately proved to be infeasible.[56][66]He was sought out by physicistNiels Bohrfor one-on-one discussions. He later discovered the reason: most of the other physicists were too much in awe of Bohr to argue with him. Feynman had no such inhibitions, vigorously pointing out anything he considered to be flawed in Bohr's thinking. He said he felt as much respect for Bohr as anyone else, but once anyone got him talking about physics, he would become so focused he forgot about social niceties. Perhaps because of this, Bohr never warmed to Feynman.[67][68] At Los Alamos, which was isolated for security, Feynman amused himself by investigating the combination locks on the cabinets and desks of physicists. He often found that they left the lock combinations on the factory settings, wrote the combinations down, or used easily guessable combinations like dates.[69]He found one cabinet's combination by trying numbers he thought a physicist might use (it proved to be 27–18–28 after the base ofnatural logarithms,e= 2.71828 ...), and found that the three filing cabinets where a colleague kept research notes all had the same combination. He left notes in the cabinets as a prank, spooking his colleague,Frederic de Hoffmann, into thinking a spy had gained access to them.[70] Feynman's $380 (equivalent to $7,000 in 2023) monthly salary was about half the amount needed for his modest living expenses and Arline's medical bills, and they were forced to dip into her $3,300 (equivalent to $58,000 in 2023) in savings.[71]On weekends he borrowed a car from his friendKlaus Fuchsto drive to Albuquerque to see Arline.[72][73]Asked who at Los Alamos was most likely to be a spy, Fuchs mentioned Feynman'ssafe-crackingand frequent trips to Albuquerque;[72]Fuchs himself later confessed to spying for theSoviet Union.[74]TheFBIwould compile a bulky file on Feynman,[75]particularly in view of Feynman'sQ clearance.[76] Informed that Arline was dying, Feynman drove to Albuquerque and sat with her for hours until she died on June 16, 1945.[77]He then immersed himself in work on the project and was present at theTrinity nuclear test. Feynman claimed to be the only person to see the explosion without the very dark glasses or welder's lenses provided, reasoning that it was safe to look through a truck windshield, as it would screen out the harmfulultravioletradiation. The immense brightness of the explosion made him duck to the truck's floor, where he saw a temporary \"purple splotch\"afterimage.[78]"

As news of the lectures' lucidity grew, professional physicists and graduate students began to drop in to listen. Co-authorsRobert B. Leightonand Matthew Sands, colleagues of Feynman, edited and illustrated them into book form. The work has endured and is useful to this day.They were edited and supplemented in 2005 withFeynman's Tips on Physics: A Problem-Solving Supplement to the Feynman Lectures on Physicsby Michael Gottlieb and Ralph Leighton (Robert Leighton's son), with support fromKip Thorneand other physicists."

        "output": "At Caltech, Feynman investigated the physics of thesuperfluidityof supercooledliquid helium, where helium seems to display a complete lack ofviscositywhen flowing. Feynman provided a quantum-mechanical explanation for the Soviet physicistLev Landau's theory of superfluidity.[143]Applying the Schrödinger equation to the question showed that the superfluid was displaying quantum mechanical behavior observable on a macroscopic scale. This helped with the problem ofsuperconductivity, but the solution eluded Feynman.[144]It was solved with theBCS theoryof superconductivity, proposed byJohn Bardeen,Leon Neil Cooper, andJohn Robert Schriefferin 1957.[143] Feynman, inspired by a desire to quantize the Wheeler–Feynman absorber theory of electrodynamics, laid the groundwork for the path integral formulation and Feynman diagrams.[44] WithMurray Gell-Mann, Feynman developed a model ofweak decay, which showed that the current coupling in the process is a combination of vector and axial currents (an example of weak decay is the decay of a neutron into an electron, a proton, and anantineutrino). AlthoughE. C. George Sudarshanand Robert Marshak developed the theory nearly simultaneously, Feynman's collaboration with Gell-Mann was seen as seminal because theweak interactionwas neatly described by the vector and axial currents. It thus combined the 1933beta decaytheory ofEnrico Fermiwith an explanation ofparity violation.[145] Feynman attempted an explanation, called theparton model, of thestrong interactionsgoverning nucleon scattering. The parton model emerged as a complement to thequark modeldeveloped by Gell-Mann. The relationship between the two models was murky; Gell-Mann referred to Feynman's partons derisively as \"put-ons\". In the mid-1960s, physicists believed that quarks were just a bookkeeping device for symmetry numbers, not real particles; the statistics of theomega-minus particle, if it were interpreted as three identical strange quarks bound together, seemed impossible if quarks were real.[146][147] TheSLAC National Accelerator Laboratorydeep inelastic scatteringexperiments of the late 1960s showed thatnucleons(protons and neutrons) contained point-like particles that scattered electrons. It was natural to identify these with quarks, but Feynman's parton model attempted to interpret the experimental data in a way that did not introduce additional hypotheses. For example, the data showed that some 45% of the energy momentum was carried by electrically neutral particles in the nucleon. These electrically neutral particles are now seen to be thegluonsthat carry the forces between the quarks, and their three-valued color quantum number solves the omega-minus problem. Feynman did not dispute the quark model; for example, when the fifth quark was discovered in 1977, Feynman immediately pointed out to his students that the discovery implied the existence of a sixth quark, which was discovered in the decade after his death.[146][148] After the success of quantum electrodynamics, Feynman turned toquantum gravity. By analogy with the photon, which has spin 1, he investigated the consequences of a free massless spin 2 field and derived theEinstein field equationof general relativity, but little more. The computational device that Feynman discovered then for gravity, \"ghosts\", which are \"particles\" in the interior of his diagrams that have the \"wrong\" connection between spin and statistics, have proved invaluable in explaining the quantum particle behavior of theYang–Mills theories, for example,quantum chromodynamicsand theelectro-weaktheory.[149]He did work on all four of thefundamental interactionsof nature:electromagnetic, theweak force, thestrong forceand gravity. John and Mary Gribbin state in their book on Feynman that \"Nobody else has made such influential contributions to the investigation of all four of the interactions\".[150] Partly as a way to bring publicity to progress in physics, Feynman offered $1,000 prizes fortwo of his challenges in nanotechnology; one was claimed byWilliam McLellanand the other byTom Newman.[151] Feynman was also interested in the relationship between physics and computation. He was also one of the first scientists to conceive the possibility ofquantum computers.[152][153][154]In the 1980s he began to spend his summers working atThinking Machines Corporation, helping to build some of the first parallel supercomputers and considering the construction of quantum computers.[155][156] In 1984–1986, he developed a variational method for the approximate calculation of path integrals, which has led to a powerful method of converting divergent perturbation expansions into convergent strong-coupling expansions (variational perturbation theory) and, as a consequence, to the most accurate determination[157]ofcritical exponentsmeasured in satellite experiments.[158]At Caltech, he once chalked \"What I cannot create I do not understand\" on his blackboard.[159]"

In the 1980s, working withRalph Leighton(Robert Leighton's son), he recorded chapters onaudio tapethat Ralph transcribed. The book was published in 1985 asSurely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!and became a best-seller.[174] Gell-Mann was upset by Feynman's account in the book of the weak interaction work, and threatened to sue, resulting in a correction being inserted in later editions.[175]This incident was just the latest provocation in decades of bad feeling between the two scientists. Gell-Mann often expressed frustration at the attention Feynman received;[176]he remarked:\"[Feynman]was a great scientist, but he spent a great deal of his effort generating anecdotes about himself.\"[177] Feynman has been criticized for a chapter in the book entitled \"You JustAskThem?\", where he describes how he learned to seduce women at a bar he went to in the summer of 1946. A mentor taught him to ask a woman if she would sleep with him before buying her anything. He describes seeing women at the bar as \"bitches\" in his thoughts, and tells a story of how he told a woman named Ann that she was \"worse than a whore\" after Ann persuaded him to buy her sandwiches by telling him he could eat them at her place, but then, after he bought them, saying they actually could not eat together because another man was coming over. Later on that same evening, Ann returned to the bar to take Feynman to her place.[178][179][180]Feynman states at the end of the chapter that this behaviour was not typical of him: \"So it worked even with an ordinary girl! But no matter how effective the lesson was, I never really used it after that. I didn't enjoy doing it that way. But it was interesting to know that things worked much differently from how I was brought up.\"[113]"
