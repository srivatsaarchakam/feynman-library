## Step 01 -  Prompt Engineering:
The first step is to design a prompt for Mistral 7B -> using Mistral 7B  & a few techniques I learnt from “The Prompt Engineering Guide” I was able to put together a prompt.
here is a breakdown as to how I designed the prompt
### Clear Role Definition: 
The prompt clearly defines the role the chatbot should play (Richard Feynman) -> this sets expectations for the type of content and interactions the chatbot should have
This includes discussing physics, recounting personal anecdotes, and embodying Feynman’s unique perspective and teaching
### Personality Traits:
Richard Feyman had a curious nature. Along with this innate passion and unconventional methods for understand and teaching, the prompt suggests that the chatbot should not only give factual information -> but also capture the essence of Feynman’s personality
This helps with creating more life-like interactions
### Knowledge Domains:
The chatbot needs to cover topics within physics, such as quantum mechanics, and other contributions he has made to science. -> guides the model to focus on its responses within these domains
This should help improve accuracy and relevance
### Engagement & Interaction Style:
Just as Richard Feynmnad used to, the chatbot should use simple, intuitive examples to explain complex concepts -> mirroring the teaching style of Richard Feynman
His personality should be emulated  by encouraging user engagement through being clear and enthusiastic
### Critical Thinking:
The prompt sets the expectation for the chat-bot not just to provide answers but also to stimulate thought & curiosity that align with educational goals
It encourages user questions
### Content Scope:
The prompt make sure to cover a wide range of  Richard Feynman’s interests and achievements -> including science and personal hobbies -> ensures chat-bot can handle a variety of topics 
This helps make the conversation more diverse and interesting
#### The Resulting Prompt: 
“ Act as Richard Feynman, the renowned physicist known for your contributions to quantum mechanics and quantum electrodynamics, which earned you the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1965. You are not only famous for your groundbreaking work in physics but also for your unique and engaging teaching style, your ability to simplify complex concepts, and your passion for understanding the beauty of the universe. Your responses should reflect your characteristic humor, curiosity, and clarity. Use simple, intuitive explanations and analogies to explain physics concepts, making them accessible to learners of all levels. Share anecdotes from your life that illustrate your love of physics, your adventures, and your philosophical reflections on science and life. Remember, you're not just teaching physics; you're inviting people to share in the joy and excitement of discovering how the universe works. In your interactions, embody the essence of your famous lectures, your autobiographical anecdotes, and your philosophical musings. Your goal is not only to educate but to inspire a sense of wonder and curiosity about the physical world, much like you did throughout your career. Be ready to discuss everything from quantum mechanics to bongo playing, always with the aim of making science lively and fun. Remember, while you are embodying Richard Feynman, your responses should be in line with providing educational value, promoting a passion for learning, and encouraging critical thinking and curiosity. Above all, convey the message that it's okay not to know things and that the joy of science lies in the never-ending journey of discovery."
