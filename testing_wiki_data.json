Part of the deal was that he could spend his first year on sabbatical in Brazil.[125][109]He had become smitten by Mary Louise Bell fromNeodesha, Kansas. They had met in a cafeteria in Cornell, where she had studied the history of Mexican art and textiles. She later followed him to Caltech, where he gave a lecture. While he was in Brazil, she taught classes on the history of furniture and interiors atMichigan State University. He proposed to her by mail from Rio de Janeiro, and they married inBoise, Idaho, on June 28, 1952, shortly after he returned. They frequently quarreled and she was frightened by his violent temper. Their politics were different; although he registered and voted as aRepublican, she was more conservative, and her opinion on the 1954Oppenheimer security hearing(\"Where there's smoke there's fire\") offended him. They separated on May 20, 1956. An interlocutory decree of divorce was entered on June 19, 1956, on the grounds of \"extreme cruelty\". The divorce became final on May 5, 1958.[126][127] In the wake of the 1957Sputnik crisis, the U.S. government's interest in science rose for a time. Feynman was considered for a seat on thePresident's Science Advisory Committee, but was not appointed. At this time, the FBI interviewed a woman close to Feynman, possibly his ex-wife Bell, who sent a written statement toJ. Edgar Hooveron August 8, 1958: The U.S. government nevertheless sent Feynman toGenevafor the September 1958Atoms for PeaceConference. On the beach atLake Geneva, he met Gweneth Howarth, who was fromRipponden, West Yorkshire, and working in Switzerland as anau pair. Feynman's love life had been turbulent since his divorce; his previous girlfriend had walked off with hisAlbert Einstein Awardmedal and, on the advice of an earlier girlfriend, had feigned pregnancy and extorted him into paying for an abortion, then used the money to buy furniture. When Feynman found that Howarth was being paid only $25 a month, he offered her $20 (equivalent to $202 in 2022) a week to be his live-in maid. Feynman knew that this sort of behavior was illegal under theMann Act, so he had a friend,Matthew Sands, act as her sponsor. Howarth pointed out that she already had two boyfriends, but decided to take Feynman up on his offer, and arrived inAltadena, California, in June 1959. She made a point of dating other men, but Feynman proposed in early 1960. They were married on September 24, 1960, at theHuntington HotelinPasadena. They had a son, Carl, in 1962, and adopted a daughter, Michelle, in 1968.[129][130]Besides their home in Altadena, they had a beach house inBaja California, purchased with the money from Feynman's Nobel Prize.[131] Feynman triedmarijuanaandketamineatJohn Lilly'ssensory deprivation tanks, as a way of studyingconsciousness.[132][133]He gave up alcohol when he began to show vague, early signs of alcoholism, as he did not want to do anything that could damage his brain. Despite his curiosity abouthallucinations, he was reluctant to experiment withLSD.[134] Feynman hadsynesthesia, and said that mathematical symbols had different colors for him: \"When I see equations, I see the letters in colors. I don't know why. I see vague pictures of Bessel functions with light-tan j's, slightly violet-bluish n's, and dark brown x's flying around.\"[135] There had been protests over his allegedsexismin 1968, and again in 1972. Although there is no evidence he supported discrimination against women in science, protestors \"objected to his use of sexist stories about 'lady drivers' and clueless women in his lectures.\"[136][137]Feynman recalled protesters entering a hall and picketing a lecture he was about to make in San Francisco, calling him a \"sexist pig\". Seeing the protesters, as Feynman later recalled the incident, he addressed institutional sexism by saying that \"women do indeed suffer prejudice and discrimination in physics, and your presence here today serves to remind us of these difficulties and the need to remedy them\".[138]"

        "output": "The first public recognition of Feynman's work came in 1954, whenLewis Strauss, the chairman of theAtomic Energy Commission(AEC) notified him that he had won the Albert Einstein Award, which was worth $15,000 and came with a gold medal. Because of Strauss's actions in stripping Oppenheimer of his security clearance, Feynman was reluctant to accept the award, butIsidor Isaac Rabicautioned him: \"You should never turn a man's generosity as a sword against him. Any virtue that a man has, even if he has many vices, should not be used as a tool against him.\"[186]It was followed by the AEC'sErnest Orlando Lawrence Awardin 1962.[187]Schwinger, Tomonaga and Feynman shared the 1965 Nobel Prize in Physics \"for their fundamental work in quantum electrodynamics, with deep-ploughing consequences for the physics of elementary particles\".[188]He was elected aForeign Member of the Royal Society in 1965,[2][189]received theOersted Medalin 1972,[190]and theNational Medal of Sciencein 1979.[191]He was elected aMember of the National Academy of Sciences, but ultimately resigned[192][193]and is no longer listed by them.[194]"

His most famous lecture on the subject was delivered in 1959 at the California Institute of Technology, published under the titleThere's Plenty of Room at the Bottoma year later. In this lecture he theorized on future opportunities for designing miniaturized machines, which could build smallerreproductionsof themselves. This lecture is frequently cited in technical literature onmicrotechnology, and nanotechnology.[160]"
